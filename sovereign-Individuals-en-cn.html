        <h1>鸣谢</h1>

        <!-- <p>When the definitive “History of the Thank-You Note Through the Ages” is compiled, this whole book could well be an exhibit. It is the third we have done together on various aspects of the great transformation to the Information Age now under way. <em>The Sovereign Individual</em>builds upon research and analysis that went into <em>Blood in the Streets</em>and <em>The Great Reckoning.</em>Like those books, it appropriates the thoughts of many authorities whose work is credited in the texts and citations. It also builds upon insights gained in conversations, both recently and over the past decade. In that sense, we should probably repeat all of our acknowledgments to the friends and accomplices who helped us in crucial ways in our two previous books. For the record, we do. Those whom we have mentioned and overlooked in our previous books, please take note. You have our thanks, cubed, for a decade of stimulation and kindnesses. Our special thanks go to Bill Bonner, who has helped us stay abreast of the changing currents of publishing during the past decade. It is mainly his genius that accounts for the huge worldwide circulation of our newsletter, <em>Strategic Investment.</em>He has helped us formulate ongoing market tests of our ideas. But more to the point, he has been an indispensable friend and sounding board.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>若是终究有人能办个关于《穿越时代的感谢信》的历史展览的话，我们这本书很可能成为一个展品。这是我们共同完成的第三本关于目前正在发生的向信息时代的巨大转变的各个方面的书。《主权个体》是在《血流成河》和《大清算》的研究和分析基础上完成的。它还建立在最近和过去十年的对话中获得的见解之上。这本书『挪用』了很多权威作品中的内容，正如书中正文和脚注中出现的那样。在这个意义上，我们也许应该重复我们对那些在我们前两本书中以关键方式帮助我们的朋友们的所有感谢。为了记录在案，我们这样做了。那些我们在以前的书中提到的人，请注意：我们对你们十年来的刺激和善意表示感谢，感谢的三次方。我们特别感谢比尔·邦纳，他帮助我们在过去十年中紧跟出版业的变化潮流。他的天才使我们的通讯战略投资在全球范围内大量发行。但更重要的是，他一直是我们不可缺少的朋友和传声筒。</p>

        <!-- <p>As before, we apologize to those whom we have overlooked. We are sorry that the acknowledgment we owe them has fallen between the cracks, like an unpaid bill that got tangled up with the grocery circulars and tossed away.

        <h1>前言</h1>

        <!-- <p>Medieval men despaired of the will. They thought of humans as wounded and weak. But they respected the intellect. They thought even humans, if we think carefully, have the power to answer the most profound questions of God and the Universe.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>中世纪的人对意志感到绝望。他们认为人类是受伤的、软弱的。但他们尊重智力。他们认为即使是人类，如果我们仔细思考，也有能力回答上帝和宇宙的最深奥的问题。</p>

        <!-- <p>Modern men worship the will, but they despair of the intellect. The wisdom of crowds; the swerve of random particles; the influence of unconscious biases: all of these contemporary clichés are ways to talk about intellectual weakness—or ways to talk ourselves into it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>现代人崇拜意志，但他们对智力感到绝望。众人的智慧；随机粒子的转向；无意识偏见的影响：所有这些当代的陈词滥调都是谈论智力弱点的方式 —— 或者是诱导我们相信这些鬼话的方式。</p>

        <!-- <p>Lord William Rees-Mogg and James Dale Davidson do not promise answers about God and the Universe, nor do they supply any. But their investigation of “megapolitics”—an anatomy of the forces at work in history and a set of predictions for the near future—is unusual, or even countercultural, because it applies human reason to matters that we have been taught to leave to chance or fate.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>威廉·里斯·莫格勋爵和詹姆斯·戴尔·戴维森（即，本书作者）并没有承诺关于上帝和宇宙的答案，他们甚至没有提供任何答案。但他们对『跨政治』的研究 —— 对历史上的各种力量的剖析以及对不久的将来的一系列预测 —— 是不寻常的，甚至是反文化的，因为它将人类的理性应用于我们被教导要留给机会或命运的事情。</p>

        <blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：『跨政治』，英文原文为 <em>Megapolitics</em>。<em>mega-</em>，意为，大、超大。所以，可以将其翻译为『大政治』、『超跨政治』、『巨型政治』…… 根据书中的上下文，好像把 mega 理解为那种『特别大，大到甚至超越了哪怕是当下最大的领土国家主权的那种政治领域』… 于是，就把 Megapolitics 蹩脚地翻译成了『跨政治』。</blockquote>

        <!-- <p>Looking back almost a quarter century after the first publication of <em>The Sovereign Individual</em>, the easiest thing to do, and the thing most encouraged by the culture around us, is to look at what they got wrong—almost as if to reassure ourselves that there was no point all along in thinking carefully about the future.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在《主权个体》首次出版近四分之一个世纪之后，最容易做的事情，也是我们周围的文化最鼓励的事情，就是看看他们错了什么 —— 是为了让自己舒心，我们一直假装仔细思考未来是没有意义的。</p>

        <!-- <p>And of course, there are some things they missed: above all, the rise of China. The twenty-first-century People’s Republic of China under the Communist Party has created its very own version of the Information Age with decidedly nationalist, ethnically homogenous, profoundly statist characteristics. This is probably the single biggest “megapolitical” development since the book came out. To cite just one key illustration, Communist China has crushed the city-state of Hong Kong—whereas Rees-Mogg and Davidson had described Hong Kong as “a mental model of the kind of jurisdiction that we expect to see flourish in the Information Age.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当然，他们也错过了一些事情：首先是中国的崛起。共产党领导下的二十一世纪的中华人民共和国创造了自己的信息时代，具有明显的民族主义、种族同质化和深刻的国家主义特征。这可能是该书问世以来最大的一次『跨政治』发展。仅举一个关键的例子，共产主义中国已经粉碎了香港这个城市国家 —— 而里斯·莫格和戴维森曾将香港描述为『我们期望看到在信息时代蓬勃发展的那种管辖区的精神模型。』 </p>

        <!-- <p>On one account, this is a blind spot on the part of the authors. On another view, it can seem like China’s Politburo must have been keen readers of <em>The Sovereign Individual</em>. It is only through a unique long-term awareness that looks back to Lenin and Stalin as well as forward to the Information Age that the Party’s leaders prevailed amid the trends analyzed by this book.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>从某种意义上说，这是作者的一个盲点。从另一个角度看，这似乎表明中国政治局一定热衷于阅读《主权个体》。只有通过回顾列宁和斯大林以及展望信息时代的独特的长期意识，党的领导人才能在本书所分析的趋势中取得胜利。</p>

        <!-- <p>Those trends—winner-take-all economics, jurisdictional competition, the shift away from mass production, and the arguable obsolescence of interstate warfare—are still at work today. The rise of China is less a refutation of Rees-Mogg and Davidson than a dramatic raising of the stakes they described.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这些趋势 —— 赢家通吃的经济、管辖权的竞争、从大规模生产的转变以及国家间战争的可争议性 —— 今天仍然在发挥作用。中国的崛起与其说是对威廉·里斯·莫格勋爵和詹姆斯·戴尔·戴维森的反驳，不如说是他们所描述的利害关系所涉及的筹码极具增加。</p>

        <!-- <p>In truth, the great conflict over our megapolitical future is only just beginning. On the dimension of technology, the conflict has two poles: AI and crypto. Artificial Intelligence holds out the prospect of finally solving what economists call the “calculation problem”: AI could theoretically make it possible to centrally control an entire economy. It is no coincidence that AI is the favorite technology of the Communist Party of China. Strong cryptography, at the other pole, holds out the prospect of a decentralized and individualized world. If AI is communist, crypto is libertarian.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>事实上，关于我们跨政治未来的巨大冲突才刚刚开始。在技术层面上，冲突有两极。人工智能和加密货币。人工智能带来了最终解决经济学家所谓的『计算问题』的前景。理论上，人工智能可以使集中控制整个经济成为可能。人工智能是中国共产党最喜欢的技术，这并不是巧合。强密码学，在另一极，为一个去中心化和个性化的世界带来了前景。如果说人工智能是共产主义，那么加密技术就是自由主义。</p>

        <!-- <p>The future may lie somewhere between these two extreme poles. But we know the actions we take today will determine the overall outcome. Reading <em>The Sovereign Individual</em>in 2020 is a way to think carefully about the future that your own actions will help to create. It is an opportunity not to be wasted.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>未来可能就在这两个极端的两极之间。但我们知道，我们今天采取的行动将决定总体结果。在 2020 年阅读《主权个体》是一种仔细思考你自己的行动将有助于创造的未来的方式。这是一个不应浪费的机会。</p>

        <h2>预言</h2>

        <!-- <p>The coming of the year 2000 has haunted the Western imagination for the past thousand years. Ever since the world failed to end at the turn of the first millennium after Christ, theologians, evangelists, poets, seers, and now, even computer programmers have looked to the end of this decade with an expectation that it would bring something momentous. No less an authority than Isaac Newton speculated that the world would end with the year 2000. Michel de Nostradamus, whose prophecies have been read by every generation since they were first published in 1568, forecast the coming of the Third Antichrist in July 1999.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en2" id="text00007.html#ch01en2">2</a></sup>Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, connoisseur of the “collective unconscious,” envisioned the birth of a New Age in 1997. Such forecasts may easily be ridiculed. And so can the sober forecasts of economists, such as Dr. Edward Yardeni of Deutsche Bank Securities, who expects computer malfunctions on the millennial midnight to “disrupt the entire global economy.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en3" id="text00007.html#ch01en3">3</a></sup>But whether you view the Y2K problem computer problem as groundless hysteria ginned up by computer programmers and Information Technology consultants to stir up business, or as a mysterious instance of technology unfolding in concert with the prophetic imagination, there is no denying that circumstances at the eve of the millennium excite more than the usual morbid doubt about where the world is tending.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在过去的一千年里，2000 年的到来一直困扰着西方人的想象。自从世界在基督之后的第一个千年之交未能终结以来，神学家、传教士、诗人、预言家，甚至现在的计算机程序员都在期待着这十年的结束，期待着它会带来一些重大的事情。不亚于任何权威的艾萨克·牛顿（<em>Isaac Newton</em>）推测说世界将在 2000 年结束。米歇尔·德·诺查丹玛斯（<em>Michel de Nostradamus</em>）的预言自 1568 年首次发表以来一直被每一代人阅读，他预测第三个反基督者将于
            1999 年 7 月到来。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en2" id="text00007.html#ch01en2">2</a></sup>瑞士心理学家卡尔·荣格（<em>Carl Jung</em>），『集体无意识』的鉴赏家，预言一个新时代将在 1997 年诞生。这种预测可能很容易被嘲笑。而经济学家的冷静预测也是如此，比如德意志银行证券的爱德华·亚德尼博士（<em>Edward Yardeni</em>），他预计『千年午夜的计算机故障将扰乱整个全球经济。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en3" id="text00007.html#ch01en3">3</a></sup>也许你觉得千年虫问题只不过是一些程序员的无厘头玩笑或者是一些
            IT 专家为了多赚点钱而编出来的瞎话，又或者你认为这是一个技术与预言想象力协同发展的神秘实例，但，不可否认的是，千禧年前夕的情况比通常对世界走向的病态怀疑更让人兴奋。</p>

        <!-- <p>A sense of disquiet about the future has begun to color the optimism so characteristic of Western societies for the past 250 years. People everywhere are hesitant and worried. You see it in their faces. Hear it in their conversation. See it reflected in polls and registered in the ballot box. Just as an invisible, physical change of ions in the atmosphere signals that a thunderstorm is imminent even before the clouds darken and lightning strikes, so now, in the twilight of the millennium, premonitions of change are in the air. One person after another, each in his own way, senses that time is running out on a dying way of life. As the decade expires, a murderous century expires with it, and also a glorious millennium of human accomplishment. All draw to a close with the year 2000.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>对未来的不安感已经开始给过去 250 年来西方社会特有的乐观主义蒙上了阴影。各地的人们都在犹豫不决，忧心忡忡。你可以从他们的脸上看到这一点。在他们的谈话中听到它。看到它反映在民意调查中，并登记在投票箱中。就像大气中离子的无形物理变化预示着雷雨即将来临，甚至在云层变暗和闪电开始之前；现在，在千禧年的黄昏，变革的预感也在空气中弥漫。一个接一个的人，以自己的方式，感觉到时间在垂死的生活方式中流失。随着这十年的结束，一个杀戮的世纪也随之结束，同时也是人类成就的辉煌的千年。一切都随着 2000
            年的到来而结束了。

        <!-- <h2>THE FOURTH STAGE OF HUMAN SOCIETY</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>人类社会的第四阶段</h2>

        <!-- <p>The theme of this book is the new revolution of power which is liberating individuals at the expense of the twentieth-century nation-state. Innovations that alter the logic of violence in unprecedented ways are transforming the boundaries within which the future must lie. If our deductions are correct, you stand at the threshold of the most sweeping revolution in history. Faster than all but a few now imagine, microprocessing will subvert and destroy the nation-state, creating new forms of social organization in the process. This will be far from an easy transformation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>本书的主题是新的权力革命，它以二十世纪的领土国家为代价解放了个人。以前所未有的方式改变暴力逻辑的创新，正在改变未来必须存在的边界。如果我们的推论是正确的，你们就站在历史上最全面的革命的门槛上。微处理器的速度比现在所有人想象的都要更快，它将颠覆和摧毁领土国家，在这个过程中创造新的社会组织形式。这将是一个不容易的转变。</p>

        <blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：<em>nation-state</em>，一般翻译为『民族国家』。不过，在本书的上下文来看，<em>nation-state</em> 和中文的『民族』全无关系。在跨政治（<em>Megapolitics</em>）这个作者提出的新概念涉及的范围内，<em>nation-state</em>，指的就是那些对其领土国家中的公民进行统治的政府主体。所以，在此书的翻译中，<em>notion-state</em>，全部被翻译成了『领土国家』。</blockquote>

        <!-- <p>The challenge it will pose will be all the greater because it will happen with incredible speed compared with anything seen in the past. Through all of human history from its earliest beginnings until now, there have been only three basic stages of economic life: (1) hunting-and-gathering societies; (2) agricultural societies; and (3) industrial societies. Now, looming over the horizon, is something entirely new, the fourth stage of social organization: information societies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>它所带来的挑战将更大，因为与过去的任何事情相比，它将以难以置信的速度发生。在人类历史上，从最早的开始到现在，经济生活只有三个基本阶段。（<em>1</em>）狩猎和采集社会；（<em>2</em>）农业社会；和（<em>3</em>）工业社会。现在，地平线上出现了一个全新的东西，即社会组织的第四阶段：（<em>4</em>）信息社会。</p>

        <!-- <p>Each of the previous stages of society has corresponded with distinctly different phases in the evolution and control of violence. As we explain in detail, information societies promise to dramatically reduce the returns to violence, in part because they transcend locality. The virtual reality of cyberspace, what novelist William Gibson characterized as a “consensual hallucination,” will be as far beyond the reach of bullies as imagination can take it. In the new millennium, the advantage of controlling violence on a large scale will be far lower than it has been at any time since before the French Revolution. This will have profound consequences. One of these will be rising crime. When the payoff for organizing violence at a large scale tumbles, the payoff from violence at a smaller scale is likely to jump. Violence will become more random and localized. Organized crime will grow in scope. We explain why.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>之前的每一个社会阶段都对应着暴力演变和对暴力控制的各个明显不同阶段。正如我们将要详细解释的那样，信息社会有望大幅减少暴力的回报，部分原因是它们超越了地域性。网络空间的虚拟现实，也就是小说家威廉·吉布森（<em>William Gibson</em>）所说的『合意的幻觉』（<em>consensual hallucination</em>），将是想象力所能达到但欺凌者却不能达到的。在新的千年里，大规模掌控暴力的优势将远远低于自法国大革命之前的任何时候，这将产生深刻的后果。其中之一将是犯罪率上升。当组织大规模暴力的回报下降时，较小规模的暴力的回报可能会跃升。暴力将变得更加随机和地方化。有组织犯罪的范围将扩大。我们会解释其原因。</p>

        <!-- <p>Another logical implication of falling returns to violence is the eclipse of politics, which is the stage for crime on the largest scale. There is much evidence that adherence to the civic myths of the twentieth-century nation-state is rapidly eroding. The death of Communism is merely the most striking example. As we explore in detail, the collapse of morality and growing corruption among leaders of Western governments are not random developments. They are evidence that the potential of the nation-state is exhausted. Even many of its leaders no longer believe the platitudes they mouth. Nor are they believed by others.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>暴力回报率下降的另一个逻辑含义是政治的消失，而政治是最大规模犯罪的舞台。有很多证据表明，对二十世纪领土国家的公民神话的坚持正在迅速削弱。共产主义的死亡仅仅是最引人注目的例子。正如我们详细探讨的那样，道德的崩溃和西方政府领导人的日益腐败并不是偶然的发展。它们证明了领土国家的潜力已经耗尽。甚至，连许多领导人都不再相信他们口中的陈词滥调，并且，他们也早已失信于民众。</p>

        <!-- <h3>History Repeats Itself</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>历史会重演</h3>

        <!-- <p>This is a situation with striking parallels in the past. Whenever technological change has divorced the old forms from the new moving forces of the economy, moral standards shift, and people begin to treat those in command of the old institutions with growing disdain. This widespread revulsion often comes into evidence well before people develop a new coherent ideology of change. So it was in the late fifteenth century, when the medieval Church was the predominant institution of feudalism. Notwithstanding popular belief in “the sacredness of the sacerdotal office,” both the higher and lower ranks of clergy were held in the utmost contempt—not unlike the popular attitude toward politicians and bureaucrats today.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en5" id="text00007.html#ch01en5">5</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这种情况与过去有着惊人的相似之处。每当技术变革使旧的形式无法继续适应新的经济运动力量时，道德标准就会发生变化，人们开始越来越不屑于对待那些指挥旧机构的人。这种广泛的反感往往在人们形成一种新的变革、新的意识形态共识之前就已经显现出来。十五世纪末就是这样，当时中世纪的教会是封建主义的主要机构。尽管人们相信『圣职的神圣性』，但无论是高级还是低级的神职人员都受到了极大的蔑视 —— 这与今天人们对政治家和官僚的态度并不一样。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en5" id="text00007.html#ch01en5">5</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>We believe that much can be learned by analogy between the situation at the end of the fifteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and the situation today, when the world has become saturated with politics. The costs of supporting institutionalized religion at the end of the fifteenth century had reached a historic extreme, much as the costs of supporting government have reached a senile extreme today.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们认为，通过对十五世纪末的情况和今天的情况进行类比，我们可以学到很多东西。当时的生活已经被有组织的宗教彻底填满，而今天的世界已经被政治所统治了。在十五世纪末，支持制度化宗教的代价已经达到了历史性的极端，就像今天支持政府的代价已经达到了衰老的极端一样。</p>

        <!-- <p>We know what happened to organized religion in the wake of the Gunpowder Revolution. Technological developments created strong incentives to downsize religious institutions and lower their costs. A similar technological revolution is destined to downsize radically the nation-state early in the new millennium.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们知道在火药革命之后，有组织的宗教发生了什么。技术发展创造了强大的激励机制去缩小宗教机构的规模并降低其成本。一场类似的技术革命注定要在新千年初期从根本上缩小领土国家的规模。</p>

        <!-- <p>As the breakdown of large systems accelerates, systematic compulsion will recede as a factor shaping economic life and the distribution of income. Efficiency will become more important than the dictates of power in the organization of social institutions. This means that provinces and even cities that can effectively uphold property rights and provide for the administration of justice, while consuming few resources, will be viable sovereignties in the Information Age, as they generally have not been during the last five centuries. An entirely new realm of economic activity that is not hostage to physical violence will emerge in cyberspace. The most obvious benefits will flow to the “cognitive elite,” who will increasingly operate outside political boundaries. They are already equally at home in Frankfurt, London, New York, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Hong Kong. Incomes will become more unequal within jurisdictions and more equal between them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>随着大型系统的崩溃速度加快，系统的强制力将作为影响经济生活和收入分配的因素而消退。在社会机构的组织中，效率将变得比权力的支配更重要。这意味着，能够有效维护产权和提供司法行政的省份甚至城市，在消耗很少的资源的情况下，将成为信息时代可行的主权国家，而在过去的五个世纪里，它们通常都不是这样。一个全新的经济活动领域将在网络空间出现，它不受物理暴力的制约。最明显的好处将流向『认知精英』，他们将越来越多地在政治边界之外运作。他们在法兰克福、伦敦、纽约、布宜诺斯艾利斯、洛杉矶、东京和香港都已经有了同样的地位。辖区内的收入将变得更加不平等，而收入在这些人中则更加平等。</p>

        <!-- <p>What is more, it will happen almost everywhere at once. Technical and economic innovations will no longer be confined to small portions of the globe. The transformation will be all but universal. And it will involve a break with the past so profound that it will almost bring to life the magical domain of the gods as imagined by the early agricultural peoples like the ancient Greeks. To a greater degree than most would now be willing to concede, it will prove difficult or impossible to preserve many contemporary institutions in the new millennium. When information societies take shape they will be as different from industrial societies as the Greece of Aeschylus was from the world of the cave dwellers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>更重要的是，它几乎将同时在各地发生。技术和经济创新将不再局限于全球的一小部分地区。这种转变几乎是普遍的。而且，它将涉及与过去的深刻决裂，以至于它几乎会使古希腊等早期农业民族所想象的诸神的神奇领域复活。在一个比大多数人现在愿意承认的更大的程度上，在新的千年里，将证明很难或不可能保留许多当代机构。当信息社会形成时，它们与工业社会的区别就像埃斯库罗斯的希腊与山洞居民的世界一样。</p>

In the Information Society, no one who is truly able will be detained by the ill-formed opinions of others. It will not matter what most of the people on earth might think of your race, your looks, your age, your sexual proclivities, or the way you wear your hair.

The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of humans in parts of the world that never shared fully in the prosperity of industrial society. The brightest, most successful and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>At first, only a handful will achieve full financial sovereignty. But this does not negate the advantages of financial independence. The fact that not everyone attains an equally vast fortune does not mean that it is futile or meaningless to become rich. There are 25,000 millionaires for every billionaire. If you are a millionaire and not a billionaire, that does not make you poor. Equally, in the future, one of the milestones by which you measure your financial success will be not just now many zeroes you can add to your net worth, but whether you can structure your affairs in a way that enables you to realize full individual autonomy and independence. The more clever you are, the less propulsion you will require to achieve financial escape velocity. Persons of even quite modest means will soar, as the gravitational pull of politics on the global economy weakens. Unprecedented financial independence will be a reachable goal in your lifetime or that of your children.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>起初，只有少数人将实现完全的金融主权。但这并不能否定财务独立的优势。不是每个人都能获得同样巨大的财富，这并不意味着成为富人是徒劳的或毫无意义的。每一个亿万富翁都对应着另外 25,000 个百万富翁。如果你是一个百万富翁而不是亿万富翁，这并不意味着你是穷人。同样，在未来，你衡量你的财务成功的里程碑之一将不仅仅是你现在能在你的净资产上增加多少个零，而是你是否能以一种使你能实现完全的个人自主和独立的方式来安排你的事务。你越聪明，你实现财务逃逸速度所需的推进力就越小。随着政治对全球经济的引力减弱，即使是收入相当低的人也会飞黄腾达。前所未有的财务独立将是你或你的孩子一生中可以实现的目标。</p>

        <!-- <p>At the highest plateau of productivity, these Sovereign Individuals will compete and interact on terms that echo the relations among the gods in Greek myth. The elusive Mount Olympus of the next millennium will be in cyberspace—a realm without physical existence that will nonetheless develop what promises to be the world’s largest economy by the second decade of the new millennium. By 2025, the cybereconomy will have many millions of participants. Some of them will be as rich as Bill Gates, worth tens of billions of dollars each. The cyberpoor may be those with an income of less than $200,000 a year. There will be no cyberwelfare. No cybertaxes and no cybergovernment.

        <!-- <p>The good news is that politicians will no more be able to dominate, suppress, and regulate the greater part of commerce in this new realm than the legislators of the ancient Greek city-states could have trimmed the beard of Zeus. That is good news for the rich. And even better news for the not so rich. The obstacles and burdens that politics imposes are more obstacles to becoming rich than to being rich. The benefits of declining returns to violence and devolving jurisdictions will create scope for every energetic and ambitious person to benefit from the death of politics. Even the consumers of government services will benefit as entrepreneurs extend the benefits of competition. Heretofore, competition between jurisdictions has usually meant competition by means of violence to enforce the rule of a predominant group. Consequently, much of the ingenuity of interjurisdictional competition was channeled into military endeavor. But the advent of the cybereconomy will bring competition on new terms to provision of sovereignty services. A proliferation of jurisdictions will mean proliferating experimentation in new ways of enforcing contracts and otherwise securing the safety of persons and property. The liberation of a large part of the global economy from political control will oblige whatever remains of government as we have known it to operate on more nearly market terms. Governments will ultimately have little choice but to treat populations in territories they serve more like customers, and less in the way that organized criminals treat the victims of a shakedown racket.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>好消息是，政治家们将无法支配、压制和监管这个新领域的大部分商业，就像古希腊城邦的立法者无法修剪宙斯的胡子一样。这对富人来说是个好消息。对于不那么富有的人来说，这更是一个好消息。政治带来的障碍和负担，与其说是致富的障碍，不如说是致富的负担。暴力回报率下降和管辖权下放的好处将为每一个精力充沛、雄心勃勃的人创造空间，让他们从政治的死亡中获益。甚至政府服务的消费者也将受益，因为企业家们会扩大竞争的好处。迄今为止，管辖区之间的竞争通常意味着通过暴力手段来执行一个主导集团的统治。因此，司法管辖区之间竞争的大部分智慧都被引向了军事努力。但网络经济的出现将为主权服务的提供带来新的竞争条件。管辖权的扩散将意味着在执行合同和确保人身和财产安全的新方法方面的实验的扩散。全球经济的很大一部分从政治控制中解放出来，将迫使我们所知的政府的任何剩余部分在更接近市场的条件下运作。政府最终将别无选择，只能像对待客户一样对待他们所服务的地区的居民，而不是像有组织的罪犯对待敲诈勒索的受害者那样。</p>

        <!-- <p>The emergence of the sovereign individual will demonstrate yet again the strange prophetic power of myth. Conceiving little of the laws of nature, the early agricultural peoples imagined that “powers we should call supernatural” were widely distributed. These powers were sometimes employed by men, sometimes by “incarnate human gods” who looked like men and interacted with them in what Sir James George Frazer described in <em>The Golden Bough</em>as “a great democracy.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en7" id="text00007.html#ch01en7">7</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>主权个体的出现将再次证明神话的奇怪预言能力。早期的农业人口对自然法则知之甚少，他们认为『我们应该称之为超自然的力量』无所不在。这些力量有时由人使用，有时由『化身为人的神』使用，他们看起来像人，并在詹姆斯·乔治·弗雷泽爵士在《金枝》中描述的『伟大的民主』中与他们互动。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en7" id="text00007.html#ch01en7">7</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>When the ancients imagined the children of Zeus living among them they were inspired by a deep belief in magic. They shared with other primitive agricultural peoples an awe of nature, and a superstitious conviction that nature’s works were set in motion by individual volition, by magic. In that sense, there was nothing self-consciously prophetic about their view of nature and their gods. They were far from anticipating microtechnology. They could not have imagined its impact in altering the marginal productivity of individuals thousands of years later. They certainly could not have foreseen how it would shift the balance between power and efficiency and thus revolutionize the way that assets are created and protected. Yet what they imagined as they spun their myths has a strange resonance with the world you are likely to see.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当古人想象宙斯的孩子生活在他们中间时，他们受到了对魔法的深刻信仰的启发。他们与其他原始农业民族一样，对自然充满敬畏，并迷信自然界的工作是由个人意志和魔法启动的。从这个意义上说，他们对自然和神灵的看法没有任何自觉的预见性。他们远远没有预见到微观技术。他们不可能想象到它在几千年后改变个人的边际生产力的影响。他们当然不可能预见到它将如何改变权力和效率之间的平衡，从而彻底改变创造和保护资产的方式。然而，他们在编织神话时所想象的，与你可能看到的世界有一种奇怪的共鸣。</p>

Early generations of “digital servants” already obey the commands of those who control the computers in which they are sealed much as genies were sealed in magic lamps.

The new organization of society implied by the triumph of individual autonomy and the true equalization of opportunity based upon merit will lead to very great rewards for merit and great individual autonomy. This will leave individuals far more responsible for themselves than they have been accustomed to being during the industrial period. It will also precipitate transition crises, including a possibly severe economic depression that will reduce the unearned advantage in living standards that has been enjoyed by residents of advanced industrial societies throughout the twentieth century. As we write, the top 15 percent of the world’s population have an average per-capita income of $21,000 annually. The remaining 85 percent of the world have an average income of just $1,000.

        <p>对于任何热爱人类愿望和成功的人来说，信息时代将提供丰厚的回报。这无疑是许多世代以来最好的消息。但是，这也是一个坏消息。个人自主权的胜利和基于能力的真正机会均等化所隐含的新社会组织将导致对能力的极大奖励以及赋予个人的极大自主权。这将使个人对自己的责任比他们在工业时期所习惯的要大得多。它还将引发转型危机，包括可能出现的严重经济萧条，这将减少先进工业社会居民在整个二十世纪享有的不劳而获的生活水平优势。在我们写这篇文章的时候，世界上最高的 15% 的人口每年的平均人均收入为 21,000
            美元。世界上其余 85% 的人的平均收入只有 1,000 美元。在信息时代的新条件下，过去那种巨大的、囤积的优势必然会消散。</p>

When technology is mobile, and transactions occur in cyberspace, as they increasingly will do, governments will no longer be able to charge more for their services than they are worth to the people who pay for them. Anyone with a portable computer and a satellite link will be able to conduct almost any information business anywhere, and that includes almost the whole of the world’s multitrillion-dollar financial transactions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在这种情况下，领土国家大规模重新分配收入的能力将崩溃。信息技术促进了管辖区之间竞争的急剧增加。当技术是移动的，并且交易发生在网络空间时（它们将越来越多地发生），政府将不再能够为他们的服务收取高于他们对支付这些服务的人的价值。任何拥有便携式电脑和卫星链接的人将能够在任何地方进行几乎所有的信息业务，这包括几乎整个世界上价值数亿美元的金融交易。</p>

        <!-- <p>This means that you will no longer be obliged to live in a high-tax jurisdiction in order to earn high income. In the future, when most wealth can be earned anywhere, and even spent anywhere, governments that attempt to charge too much as the price of domicile will merely drive away their best customers. If our reasoning is correct, and we believe it is, the nation-state as we know it will not endure in anything like its present form.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <h2>THE END OF NATIONS</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>国家的终结</h2>

        <!-- <p>Changes that diminish the power of predominant institutions are both unsettling and dangerous. Just as monarchs, lords, popes, and potentates fought ruthlessly to preserve their accustomed privileges in the early stages of the modern period, so today’s governments will employ violence, often of a covert and arbitrary kind, in the attempt to hold back the clock. Weakened by the challenge from technology, the state will treat increasingly autonomous individuals, its former citizens, with the same range of ruthlessness and diplomacy it has heretofore displayed in its dealing with other governments. The advent of this new stage in history was punctuated with a bang on August 20, 1998, when the United States fired about $200 million worth of Tomahawk BGM-109 sea-launched cruise missiles at targets allegedly associated with an exiled Saudi millionaire, Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden became the first person in history to have his satellite phone targeted for attack by cruise missiles. Simultaneously, the United States destroyed a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, in Bin Laden’s honor. The emergence of Bin Laden as the enemy-in-chief of the United States reflects a momentous change in the nature of warfare. A single individual, albeit one with hundreds of millions of dollars, can now be depicted as a plausible threat to the greatest military power of the Industrial era. In statements reminiscent of propaganda employed during the Cold War about the Soviet Union, the United States president and his national security aides portrayed Bin Laden, a private individual, as a transnational terrorist and leading enemy of the United States.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>削弱主导机构权力的变化既令人不安，也很危险。正如君主、领主、教皇和权贵们在现代时期的早期阶段为维护其惯有的特权而进行的无情斗争一样，今天的政府也会使用暴力，而且往往是隐蔽和任意的暴力，以试图阻止时间推移中的变化。在技术挑战的削弱下，国家将以其在与其他政府打交道时表现出的同样的无情和外交手段来对待日益自主的个人，即其前公民。1998 年 8 月 20 日，美国向据称与流亡的沙特百万富翁乌萨马·本·拉登有关的目标发射了价值约 2 亿美元的战斧式 BGM-109 海射巡航导弹，这标志着历史上这个新阶段的到来。本·拉登成为历史上第一个其手持的卫星电话被当作巡航导弹攻击目标的人。同时，美国为了本·拉登一个人，竟然摧毁了苏丹喀土穆的一家制药厂。本·拉登成为美国的头号敌人，反映了战争性质的重大变化。一个人，尽管拥有数亿美元，现在可以被描绘成对工业时代最伟大的军事力量的可信的威胁。美国总统和他的国家安全助手在声明中，让人联想到冷战时期对苏联的宣传，把本·拉登这个个人描绘成一个跨国恐怖分子和美国的主要敌人。</p>

        <!-- <p>The same military logic that has seen Osama bin Laden elevated to a position as the chief enemy of the United States will assert itself in governments’ internal relations with their subjects. Increasingly harsh techniques of exaction will be a logical corollary of the emergence of a new type of bargaining between governments and individuals. Technology will make individuals more nearly sovereign than ever before. And they will be treated that way. Sometimes violently, as enemies, sometimes as equal parties in negotiation, sometimes as allies. But however ruthlessly governments behave, particularly in the transition period, wedding the IRS with the CIA will avail them little. They will be increasingly required by the press of necessity to bargain with autonomous individuals whose resources will no longer be so easily controlled.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>与把奥萨马·本·拉登被提升为美国的主要敌人的同样军事逻辑，将在政府与其国民的内部关系中得到体现。越来越严厉的征收技术将是政府和个人之间出现新型谈判的必然结果。技术将使个人比以往任何时候都更接近主权。而他们也将被这样对待。有时是作为敌人的暴力对待，有时是作为谈判的平等方，有时是作为盟友。但是，无论政府的行为多么无情，特别是在过渡时期，即便与美国中央情报局以及国税局联手也对他们来说也作用不大。他们将越来越多地被必要的媒体要求与自主的个人进行谈判，而这些个人的资源将不再那么容易被控制。</p>

        <!-- <p>The changes implied by the Information Revolution will not only create a fiscal crisis for governments, they will tend to disintegrate all large structures. Fourteen empires have disappeared already in the twentieth century. The breakdown of empires is part of a process that will dissolve the nation-state itself. Government will have to adapt to the growing autonomy of the individual. Taxing capacity will plunge by 50-70 percent. This will tend to make smaller jurisdictions more successful. The challenge of setting competitive terms to attract able individuals and their capital will be more easily undertaken in enclaves than across continents.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>信息革命所隐含的变化不仅会给政府带来财政危机，而且会使所有的大型结构解体。在二十世纪，已经有 14 个帝国消失了。帝国的瓦解是领土国家本身解体过程的一部分。政府将不得不适应个人日益增长的自主权。税收能力将骤降 50-70%。这将倾向于使较小的管辖区更加成功。设定有竞争力的条件以吸引有能力的个人及其资本的挑战，将在飞地内比在各大洲之间更容易进行。</p>

Their growing influence and power are part of the downsizing of politics. Microprocessing reduces the size that groups must attain in order to be effective in the use and control of violence.

            微处理器减少了团体必须达到的规模，以便有效地使用和控制暴力。随着这场技术革命的展开，掠夺性的暴力将越来越多地被组织在中央控制之外。遏制暴力的努力也将以更多地取决于效率而不是权力大小的方式进行。

The “virtual corporation” is evidence of a sweeping transformation in the nature of the firm, facilitated by the drop in information and transaction costs. We explore the implications of the Information Revolution for dissolving corporations and doing away with the “good job.” In the Information Age, a “job” will be a task to do, not a position you “have.” Microprocessing has created entirely new horizons of economic activity that transcend territorial boundaries. This transcendence of frontiers and territories is perhaps the most revolutionary development since Adam and Eve straggled out of paradise under the sentence of their Maker: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” As technology revolutionizes the tools we use, it also antiquates our laws, reshapes our morals, and alters our perceptions.

        <!-- <p>When the state finds itself unable to meet its committed expenditure by raising tax revenues, it will resort to other, more desperate measures. Among them is printing money. Governments have grown used to enjoying a monopoly over currency that they could depreciate at will. This arbitrary inflation has been a prominent feature of the monetary policy of all twentieth-century states. Even the best national currency of the postwar period, the German mark, lost 71 percent of its value from January 1, 1949, through the end of June 1995. In the same period, the U.S. dollar lost 84 percent of its value.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en9" id="text00007.html#ch01en9">9</a></sup>This inflation had the same effect as a tax on all who hold the currency. As we explore later, inflation as revenue option will be largely foreclosed by the emergence of cybermoney. New technologies will allow the holders of wealth to bypass the national monopolies that have issued and regulated money in the modern period. Indeed, the credit crises that swept through Asia, Russia, and other emerging economies in 1997 and 1998 attest to the fact that national currencies and national credit ratings are anachronisms inimical to the smooth operation of the global economy. It is precisely the fact that the demands of sovereignty require all transactions within a jurisdiction to be denominated in a national currency that creates the vulnerability to mistakes by central bankers and attacks by speculators which precipitated deflationary crises in one jurisdiction after another. In the Information Age, individuals will be able to use cybercurrencies and thus declare their monetary independence. When individuals can conduct their own monetary policies over the World Wide Web it will matter less or not at all that the state continues to control the industrial-era printing presses. Their importance for controlling the world’s wealth will be transcended by mathematical algorithms that have no physical existence. In the new millennium, cybermoney controlled by private markets will supersede fiat money issued by governments. Only the poor will be victims of inflation and ensuing collapses into deflation that are consequences of the artificial leverage which fiat money injects into the economy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当国家发现自己无法通过提高税收来满足其承诺的支出时，它将诉诸于其他更绝望的措施。其中之一就是印钞票。政府已经习惯于享有对货币的垄断权，他们可以随意将其贬值。这种任意的通货膨胀一直是二十世纪所有国家货币政策的一个突出特点。即使是战后最好的国家货币 —— 德国马克，从 1949 年 1 月 1 日到 1995 年 6 月底，也损失了 71% 的价值。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en9" id="text00007.html#ch01en9">9</a></sup>这种通货膨胀的效果与对所有持有货币的人征税相同。正如我们在后面探讨的那样，通货膨胀作为收入的选择将在很大程度上被网络货币的出现所排除。新技术将允许财富持有者绕过在现代时期发行和监管货币的国家垄断机构。事实上，1997
            年和 1998 年席卷亚洲、俄罗斯和其他新兴经济体的信贷危机证明，国家货币和国家信贷评级是不合时宜的，不利于全球经济的顺利运作。正是由于主权的要求要求一个司法管辖区内的所有交易都以国家货币计价，才造成了中央银行家的错误和投机者攻击的脆弱性，从而在一个又一个司法管辖区引发了通货紧缩危机。在信息时代，个人将能够使用网络货币，从而宣布他们的货币独立性。当个人可以通过万维网执行自己的货币政策时，国家继续控制工业时代的印刷机就不那么重要了，甚至根本不重要。它们对于控制世界财富的重要性将被没有物理存在的数学算法所超越。在新的千年里，由私人市场控制的电子货币将取代政府发行的法定货币。只有穷人会成为通货膨胀和随之而来的通货紧缩的受害者，这是法定货币注入经济的人为杠杆的后果。</p>

Think of it as a bald desire fitted with a moral toupee. We explore the moral and moralistic dimensions of the transition crisis.

The same need to identify that motivates fans of organized sports makes some partisans of nations.

Every stage of society requires its own moral rules to help individuals overcome incentive traps peculiar to the choices they face in that particular way of life. Just as a farming society could not live by the moral rules of a migratory Eskimo band, so the Information Society cannot satisfy moral imperatives that emerged to facilitate the success of a militant twentieth-century industrial state. We explain why.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>In the next few years, moral anachronism will be in evidence at the core countries of the West in much the way that it has been witnessed at the periphery over the past five centuries. Western colonists and military expeditions stimulated such crises when they encountered indigenous hunting-and-gathering bands, as well as peoples whose societies were still organized for farming. The introduction of new technologies into anachronistic settings caused confusion and moral crises. The success of Christian missionaries in converting millions of indigenous peoples can be laid in large measure to the local crises caused by the sudden introduction of new power arrangements from the outside. Such encounters recurred over and over, from the sixteenth century through the early decades of the twentieth century. We expect similar clashes early in the new millennium as Information Societies supplant those organized along industrial lines.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>You must understand and prepare for such unpleasantness. A series of transition crises lies ahead. Deflationary tribulations, such as the Asian contagion that swept through the Far East to Russia and other emerging economies in 1997 and 1998, will erupt sporadically as the dated national and international institutions left over from the Industrial Era prove inadequate to the challenges of the new, dispersed, transnational economy. The new information and communication technologies are more subversive of the modern state than any political threat to its predominance since Columbus sailed. This is important because those in power have seldom reacted peacefully to developments that undermined their authority. They are not likely to now.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

We expect to see a radical restructuring of the nature of sovereignty and the virtual death of politics before the transition is over. Instead of state domination and control of resources, you are destined to see the privatization of almost all services governments now provide.

        <!-- <h2>BANDWIDTH TRUMPS BORDERS</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>宽广的边界</h2>

        <!-- <p>The commercialization of sovereignty will make the terms and conditions of citizenship in the nation-state as dated as chivalric oaths seemed after the collapse of feudalism. Instead of relating to a powerful state as citizens to be taxed, the Sovereign Individuals of the twenty-first century will be customers of governments operating from a “new logical space.” They will bargain for whatever minimal government they need and pay for it according to contract. The governments of the Information Age will be organized along different principles than those which the world has come to expect over the past several centuries. Some jurisdictions and sovereignty services will be formed through “assortive matching,” a system by which affinities, including commercial affinities, are the basis upon which virtual jurisdictions earn allegiance. In rare cases, the new sovereignties may be holdovers of medieval organizations, like the 900-year-old Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. More commonly known as the Knights of Malta, the order is an affinity group for rich Catholics, with 10,000 current members and an annual income of several billions. The Knights of Malta issues its own passports, stamps, and money, and carries on full diplomatic relations with seventy countries. As we write it is negotiating with the Republic of Malta to reassume possession of Fort St. Angelo. Taking possession of the castle would give the Knights the missing ingredient of territoriality that will enable it to be recognized as a sovereignty. The Knights of Malta could once again become a sovereign microstate, instantly legitimized by a long history. It was from Fort St. Angelo that the Knights of Malta turned back the Turks in the Great Siege of 1565. Indeed, they ruled Malta for many years thereafter, until they were expelled by Napoleon in 1798. If the Knights of Malta were to return in the next few years, there could be no clearer evidence that the modern nation-state system, ushered in after the French Revolution, was merely an interlude in the longer sweep of history in which it has been the norm for many kinds of sovereignties to exist at the same time.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>主权的商业化将使领土国家的公民身份的条款和条件像封建主义崩溃后的骑士精神誓言一样过时。二十一世纪的主权个体不再是作为被征税的公民与强大的国家发生关系，而是成为在一个『新的逻辑空间』中运作的政府的客户。他们将为他们需要的任何最低限度的政府讨价还价，并根据合同付款。信息时代的政府将根据不同的原则组织起来，与过去几个世纪以来世界所期望的不同。一些司法管辖区和主权服务将通过『支持性匹配』形成，通过这个系统，亲缘关系，包括商业亲缘关系，是虚拟司法管辖区获得效忠的基础。在极少数情况下，新的主权国家可能是中世纪组织的遗留物，例如，那个有着
            900 年历史的耶路撒冷、罗得和马耳他圣约翰主权军事院。更广为人知的是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta" target="_blank">马耳他骑士团</a>，该组织是富裕的天主教徒的亲和团体，目前有 10,000 名成员，年收入达几十亿。马耳他骑士团发行自己的护照、邮票和货币，并与七十个国家建立了全面的外交关系。在我们写这篇文章时，它正在与马耳他共和国谈判，以重新获得圣安杰洛堡的所有权。占有该城堡将使骑士团获得缺少的领土国家要素，使其能够被承认为一个主权国家。马耳他骑士团可以再次成为一个拥有主权的微型国家，因悠久的历史而立即合法化。在
            1565 年的大围攻中，马耳他骑士团从圣安杰洛堡击退了土耳其人。事实上，此后他们统治了马耳他很多年，直到 1798 年被拿破仑驱逐出境。如果马耳他骑士团在未来几年内回归，那么没有比这更清楚的证据了，法国大革命后迎来的现代领土国家体系只是历史长河中的一个插曲，在这段历史中，多种主权国家同时存在是常态。</p>

        <!-- <p>Still another and very different model for a postmodern sovereignty based on assortive matching is the Iridium satellite telephone network. At first glance, you may think it odd to treat a cellular telephone service as a kind of sovereignty. Yet Iridium has already received recognition as a virtual sovereignty by international authorities. As you may know, Iridium is a global cellular phone service that allows subscribers to receive calls on a single number, wherever they find themselves on the planet, from Featherston, New Zealand, to the Bolivian Chaco. To allow calls to be routed to Iridium subscribers anywhere on the globe, given the architecture of global telecoms, international telecom authorities had to agree to recognize Iridium as a virtual country, with its own country code: 8816. It is a short step logically from a virtual country comprising satellite telephone subscribers to sovereignty for more coherent virtual communities on the World Wide Web that span borders. Bandwidth, or the carrying capacity of a communications medium, has been expanding faster than computational capacity multiplied after the invention of transistors. If this trend to greater bandwidth continues, as we believe likely, it is only a matter of a few years, soon after the turn of the millennium, until bandwidth becomes sufficiently capacious to make technically possible the “metaverse,” the alternative, cyberspace world imagined by the science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson. Stephenson’s “metaverse” is a dense virtual community with its own laws. We believe it is inevitable that, as the cybereconomy becomes richer, its participants will seek and obtain exemption from the anachronistic laws of nation-states. The new cybercommunities will be at least as wealthy and competent at advancing their interests as the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta. Indeed, they will be more capable of asserting themselves because of far-reaching communications and information warfare capabilities. We explore still other models of fragmented sovereignty in which small groups can effectively lease the sovereignty of weak nation-states, and operate their own economic havens much as free ports and free trade zones are licensed to do today.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>另一个非常不同的、基于辅助性匹配的后现代主权模式是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation" target="_blank">铱星卫星电话网络（<em>Iridium satellite constellation</em>）</a>。乍一看，你可能会认为把蜂窝电话服务当作一种主权是很奇怪的。然而，铱星公司已经被国际当局承认为一个虚拟主权。正如你可能知道的那样，铱星是一种全球移动电话服务，允许用户用一个号码接听电话，无论他们在地球上的任何地方，从新西兰的费瑟斯顿到玻利维亚的查科。考虑到全球电信的结构，为了使电话能够被转接到全球任何地方的铱星用户，国际电信当局必须同意承认铱星是一个虚拟国家，有自己的国家代码，8816。从一个由卫星电话用户组成的虚拟国家到万维网上跨越国界的更连贯的虚拟社区的主权，在逻辑上是很短的一步。带宽，或通信媒介的承载能力，在晶体管发明后一直比计算能力成倍增长的速度快。如果这种扩大带宽的趋势继续下去，正如我们认为可能的那样，那么，在千年之交后不久，带宽变得足够大，使『元宇宙』在技术上成为可能，即科幻小说家尼尔·斯蒂芬森所想象的另一种网络空间世界，只是一个问题。斯蒂芬森的『元宇宙』是一个密集的虚拟社区，有自己的法律。我们相信，随着网络经济变得更加丰富，其参与者将寻求并获得领土国家不合时宜的法律豁免，这是不可避免的。新的网络社区将至少像耶路撒冷、罗得岛和马耳他的圣约翰主权军事福音会一样富有，并有能力促进其利益。事实上，由于具有深远的通信和信息战能力，他们将更有能力坚持自己的立场。我们还探讨了其他一些零散的主权模式，在这些模式中，小团体可以有效地租赁弱小领土国家的主权，并经营自己的经济庇护所，就像今天的自由港和自由贸易区被许可的那样。</p>

        <!-- <p>A new moral vocabulary will be required to describe the relations of Sovereign Individuals with one another and what remains of government. We suspect that as the terms of these new relations come into focus, they will offend many people who came of age as “citizens” of twentieth-century nation-states. The end of nations and the “denationalization of the individual” will deflate some warmly held notions, such as “equal protection under the law,” that presuppose power relations that are soon to be obsolete. As virtual communities gain coherence, they will insist that their members be held accountable according to their own laws, rather than those of the former nation-states in which they happen to reside. Multiple systems of law will again coexist over the same geographic area, as they did in ancient and medieval times.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>将需要一个新的道德词汇来描述主权个体彼此之间的关系以及政府的剩余部分。我们猜想，随着这些新关系的术语成为焦点，它们将冒犯许多作为二十世纪领土国家的『公民』而长大的人。国家的终结和『个人的非国家化』将使一些热烈持有的概念，如『法律下的平等保护』，变得空洞无物，因为这些概念的前提是很快就会被淘汰的权力关系。随着虚拟社区获得一致性，他们将坚持要求他们的成员根据他们自己的法律，而不是他们碰巧居住的前领土国家的法律来承担责任。多种法律体系将再次在同一地理区域内共存，就像在古代和中世纪那样。</p>

        <!-- <p>Just as attempts to preserve the power of knights in armor were doomed to fail in the face of gunpowder weapons, so the modern notions of nationalism and citizenship are destined to be short-circuited by microtechnology. Indeed, they will eventually become comic in much the way that the sacred principles of fifteenth-century feudalism fell to ridicule in the sixteenth century. The cherished civic notions of the twentieth century will be comic anachronisms to new generations after the transformation of the year 2000. The Don Quixote of the twenty-first century will not be a knight-errant struggling to revive the glories of feudalism but a bureaucrat in a brown suit, a tax collector yearning for a citizen to audit.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>就像试图维护盔甲骑士的权力在火药武器面前注定要失败一样，现代的民族主义和公民权概念也注定要被微技术短路。事实上，它们最终会变得滑稽，就像十五世纪封建主义的神圣原则在十六世纪沦为笑柄一样。二十世纪所珍视的公民观念在 2000 年的变革之后，对新的几代人来说将是滑稽的不合时宜的。二十一世纪的堂吉诃德将不是一个为恢复封建主义的辉煌而奋斗的骑士，而是一个穿着棕色西装的官僚，一个渴望对公民进行审计的收税员。</p>

        <!-- <p>We seldom think of governments as competitive entities, except in the broadest sense, so the modern intuition about the range and possibilities of sovereignty has atrophied. In the past, when the power equation made it more difficult for groups to assert a stable monopoly of coercion, power was frequently fragmented, jurisdictions overlapped, and entities of many different kinds exercised one or more of the attributes of sovereignty. Not infrequently, the nominal overlord actually enjoyed scant power on the ground. Governments weaker than the nation-states are now faced with sustained competition in their ability to impose a monopoly of coercion over a local territory. This competition gave rise to adaptations in controlling violence and attracting allegiance that will soon be new again.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>除了在最广泛的意义上，我们很少认为政府是竞争性实体，所以现代人对主权的范围和可能性的直觉已经萎缩了。在过去，当权力等式使得团体更难以宣称对强制力的稳定垄断时，权力经常是分散的，管辖权重叠，许多不同类型的实体行使一个或多个主权属性。名义上的霸主实际上在当地享有很少的权力，这种情况并不少见。相对更小的领土国家政府，在对当地领土国家实施垄断性的强制力方面，现在正面临着持续的竞争。这种竞争催生了在控制暴力和吸引效忠方面的适应性，而这些适应性很快又会成为新的东西。</p>

        <!-- <p>When the reach of lords and kings was weak, and the claims of one or more groups overlapped at a frontier, it frequently happened that neither could decisively dominate the other. In the Middle Ages, there were numerous frontier or “march” regions where sovereignties blended together. These violent frontiers persisted for decades or even centuries in the border areas of Europe. There were marches between areas of Celtic and English control in Ireland; between Wales and England, Scotland and England, Italy and France, France and Spain, Germany and the Slav frontiers of Central Europe, and between the Christian kingdoms of Spain and the Islamic kingdom of Granada. Such march regions developed distinct institutional and legal forms of a kind that we are likely to see again in the next millennium. Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, residents of march regions seldom paid tax. What is more, they usually had a choice in deciding whose laws they were to obey, a choice that was exercised through such legal concepts as “avowal” and “distraint” that have now all but vanished. We expect such concepts to become a prominent feature of the law of Information Societies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当领主和国王的影响力很弱，而一个或多个团体的主张在边境地区重叠时，经常发生的情况是，双方都无法决定性地支配对方。在中世纪，有许多边境或『行军』地区的主权混杂在一起。在欧洲的边境地区，这些暴力的边境线持续了几十年甚至几个世纪。在爱尔兰的凯尔特人和英国人控制的地区之间，在威尔士和英格兰、苏格兰和英格兰、意大利和法国、法国和西班牙、德国和中欧的斯拉夫边境之间，以及在西班牙的基督教王国和格拉纳达的伊斯兰王国之间，都有游行。这种行进中的地区形成了独特的制度和法律形式，我们有可能在下一个千年再次看到这种形式。由于两个当局的竞争地位，行军区的居民很少交税。更重要的是，他们通常可以选择决定服从谁的法律，这种选择是通过『宣誓』和『限制』这样的法律概念来行使的，这些概念现在几乎已经消失了。我们希望这些概念能够成为信息社会法律的一个突出特点。</p>

This was never as true as it seemed fifty years ago. Now it is an anachronism, as much an artifact of industrialism as a rusting smokestack. The civic myths reflect not only a mindset that sees society’s problems as susceptible to engineering solutions; they also reflect a false confidence that resources and individuals will remain as vulnerable to political compulsion in the future as they have been in the twentieth century.

        <p>请注意，我们理解世界如何变化的方法与大多数预测者的方法非常不同。我们不是什么专家，也就是说，我们假装比那些花了整个职业生涯来培养高度专业化知识的人对某些『主题』有更多了解。恰恰相反，我们从外向内看。我们对我们所预测的对象的<strong>周边</strong>有丰富的知识。最重要的是，我们能看得到必要性的<strong>界限</strong>在哪里。当它们发生变化时，社会必然会发生变化，无论人们的愿望是什么。</p>

        <!-- <p>In our view, the key to understanding how societies evolve is to understand factors that determine the costs and rewards of employing violence. Every human society, from the hunting band to the empire, has been informed by the interactions of megapolitical factors that set the prevailing version of the “laws of nature.” Life is always and everywhere complex. The lamb and the lion keep a delicate balance, interacting at the margin. If lions were suddenly more swift, they would catch prey that now escape. If lambs suddenly grew wings, lions would starve. The capacity to utilize and defend against violence is the crucial variable that alters life at the margin.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在我们看来，理解社会如何演变的关键是要理解<strong>决定使用暴力的成本和回报的因素</strong>。每一个人类社会，从狩猎队到帝国，都受到跨政治因素的影响，这些因素设定了『自然法则』的主流版本。生活总是和到处都很复杂。羔羊和狮子保持着微妙的平衡，在边缘互动。如果狮子突然变得更敏捷，它们会抓住现在逃跑的猎物。如果羔羊突然长出翅膀，狮子就会饿死。利用和抵御暴力的能力是改变边缘生活的关键变量。</p>

        <!-- <p>We put violence at the center of our theory of megapolitics for good reason. The control of violence is the most important dilemma every society faces. As we wrote in <em>The Great Reckoning:</em></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们把暴力放在我们的跨政治理论的中心是有道理的。对暴力的控制是每个社会面临的最重要的困境。正如我们在《大清算》中写道：</p>

        <!-- <blockquote><span class="english"></span> -->
        <blockquote>

            <!-- <p>The reason that people resort to violence is that it often pays. In some ways, the simplest thing a man can do if he wants money is to take it. That is no less true for an army of men seizing an oil field than it is for a single thug taking a wallet. Power, as William Playfair wrote, “has always sought the readiest road to wealth, by attacking those who were in possession of it.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>人们诉诸暴力的原因是，它往往能带来好处。在某些方面，如果一个人想要钱，他能做的最简单的事情就是伸手去拿。对于一支夺取油田的军队来说，这一点与单个暴徒夺取钱包的情况一样。正如威廉·普莱菲尔（<em>William Playfair</em>）所写的那样，『权力总是通过攻击那些拥有财富的人，来寻找通往财富的最便捷的道路。』</p>

        <h3>对繁荣的挑战</h3>
        <!-- <p>The challenge to prosperity is precisely that predatory violence does pay well in some circumstances. War does change things. It changes the rules. It changes the distribution of assets and income. It even determines who lives and who dies. It is precisely the fact that violence does pay that makes it hard to control.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en12" id="text00007.html#ch01en12">12</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>对繁荣的挑战恰恰是掠夺性暴力在某些情况下确实报酬丰厚。战争确实改变了一切。它改变了规则。它改变了资产和收入的分配。它甚至决定了谁的生命和谁的死亡。恰恰是暴力确实有报酬这一事实使它难以控制。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en12" id="text00007.html#ch01en12">12</a></sup></p>

Average hourly wages in the United States have fallen below those achieved in the second Eisenhower administration. In 1993, average annualized hourly wages in constant dollars were $18,808.

To the world’s good fortune, this has not come to pass, at least not to the degree that we feared. Press reports indicate that Iran purchased several tactical nuclear weapons on the black market; more worryingly, the <em>Times</em>of London reported on October 7, 1998, that “Osama bin Laden, the exiled millionaire Saudi terrorist leader, has acquired tactical nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Central Asian states, according to a leading Arab newspaper.” That said, there has been no officially confirmed deployment or use of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the former Soviet Union.</li><span class="english"></span> -->

With tens of billions of dollars in hidden monopoly profits piling up each year, drug dealers have the means as well as the incentive to corrupt even apparently stable countries.

In <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>we drew upon and elaborated arguments of an almost entirely forgotten classic of megapolitical analysis, William Playfair’s <em>An Enquiry into the Permanent Causes of the Decline and Fall of Powerful and Wealthy Nations,</em>published in 1805. Here one of our departure points is the work of Frederic C. Lane. Lane was a medieval historian who wrote several penetrating essays on the role of violence in history during the 1940s and 1950s. Perhaps the most comprehensive of these was “Economic Consequences of Organized Violence,” which appeared in the <em>Journal of Economic History</em>in 1958. Few people other than professional economists and historians have read it, and most of them seem not to have recognized its significance. Like Playfair, Lane wrote for an audience that did not yet exist.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>The window Lane opened into the future was one through which he peered into the past. He was a medieval historian, and particularly a historian of a trading city, Venice, whose fortunes surged and sagged in a violent world. In thinking about how Venice rose and fell, his attention was attracted to issues that can help you understand the future. He saw the fact that how violence is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining “what uses are made of scarce resources.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en13" id="text00007.html#ch01en13">13</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

But don’t expect most people to notice, much less follow, so unfashionably abstract an argument. While the attention of the world is riveted on dishonest debates and wayward personalities, the meanderings of megapolitics continue almost unnoted. The average North American has probably lavished one hundred times more attention on O. J. Simpson and Monica Lewinsky than he has on the new microtechnologies that are poised to antiquate his job and subvert the political system he depends on for unemployment compensation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们相信，莱恩对暴力的竞争性使用的分析，对信息时代的生活可能发生的变化有很多启示。但是，不要指望大多数人注意到，更不要指望他们会遵循如此不合时宜的抽象论点。当全世界的注意力都集中在不诚实的辩论和不守规矩的人身上时，跨政治的蜿蜒曲折几乎没有人注意。普通的北美人对 O·J·辛普森和莫妮卡·莱温斯基的关注可能比他对新的微观技术的关注多一百倍，这些技术准备使他的工作过时并颠覆他赖以获得失业补偿的政治制度。</p>

        <p>忽视根本重要性的倾向并不仅仅局限于看电视的沙发客。形形色色的传统思想家观察到了民主领土国家的一个假象 —— 即人们持有的观点决定了世界的变化方式。看似成熟的分析家们会陷入解释和预测，把重大的历史发展解释得好像是一厢情愿地决定。就在我们写作的时候，这种推理的一个突出例子出现在《纽约时报》的社论版上，<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en14" id="text00007.html#ch01en14">14</a></sup>不仅主题是领土国家的死亡，正是我们正在讨论的话题，而且其作者把自己作为一个很好的标志，说明我们的思维方式与常规有多大差距。科尔切斯特不是一个简单的人。他是作为《经济学家》情报组的编辑主任而写作的。如果有人应该对世界形成一个现实的看法，那应该是他。然而，他的文章在多处明确指出，『国际政府的到来，现在在逻辑上是不可阻挡的。』</p>

        <!-- <p>Why? Because the nation-state is faltering and can no longer control economic forces.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>为什么？因为领土国家已经摇摇欲坠，无法再控制经济力量。</p>

        <!-- <p>In our view, this assumption verges on the absurd. To suppose that some specific new form of governance will emerge simply because another has failed is a fallacy. By that reasoning, Haiti and the Congo would long ago have had better government simply because what they had was so luminously inadequate.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在我们看来，这种假设近乎荒唐。假设某种特定的新治理形式将出现，仅仅是因为另一种形式已经失败，这是一种谬论。按照这种推理，海地和刚果早就有了更好的政府，只是因为他们所拥有的是如此明显的不足。</p>

        <!-- <p>Colchester’s point of view, widely shared among the few who think about such things in North America and Europe, utterly fails to take into account the larger megapolitical forces that determine what types of political systems are actually viable. That is the focus of this book. When the technologies that are shaping the new millennium are considered, it is far more likely that we will see not one world government, but microgovernment, or even conditions approaching anarchy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>科尔切斯特的观点在北美和欧洲少数思考此类问题的人中广为流传，但他完全没有考虑到决定哪些类型的政治制度实际可行的更大的『跨政治』力量。这就是本书的重点。当考虑到正在塑造新千年的技术时，我们更有可能看到的不是一个世界政府，而是微观政府，甚至是接近无政府状态的条件。</p>

        <!-- <p>For every serious analysis of the role of violence in determining the rules by which everyone operates, dozens of books have been written about the intricacies of wheat subsidies, and hundreds more about arcane aspects of monetary policy. Much of this shortfall in thinking about the crucial issues that actually determine the course of history probably reflects the relative stability of the power configuration over the past several centuries. The bird that falls asleep on the back of a hippopotamus does not think about losing its perch until the hippo actually moves. Dreams, myths, and fantasies play a much larger role in informing the supposed social sciences than we commonly think.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>This is particularly evident in the abundant literature of economic justice. Millions of words have been uttered and written about economic justice and injustice for each page devoted to careful analysis of how violence shapes society, and thus sets the boundaries within which economies must function. Yet formulations of economic justice in the modern context presuppose that society is dominated by an instrument of compulsion so powerful that it can take away and redistribute life’s good things. Such power has existed for only a few generations of the modern period. Now it is fading away.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这一点在关于经济正义的大量文献中尤其明显。关于经济正义和不公正，人们已经说了几百万字，每一页都在仔细分析暴力如何塑造社会，并因此设定经济必须运作的界限。然而，在现代背景下对经济正义的表述是以社会被一种强大的强制工具所支配为前提的，它可以拿走和重新分配生活中的美好事物。这种权力只在现代时期的几代人中存在过。现在，它正在逐渐消失。</p>

        <!-- <p>Some of the shrewdest observers of the mid-twentieth century became convinced on the evidence of the day that the tendency of the nation-state to centralize power would lead to totalitarian domination over all aspects of life. In George Orwell’s <em>1984</em> (1949), Big Brother was watching the individual vainly struggle to maintain a margin of autonomy and self-respect. It appeared to be a losing cause. Friedrich von Hayek’s <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> (1944) took a more scholarly view in arguing that freedom was being lost to a new form of economic control that left the state as the master of everything. These works were written before the advent of microprocessing, which has incubated a whole range of technologies that enhance the capacity of small groups and even individuals to function independently of central authority.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>二十世纪中期，一些最精明的观察家根据当时的证据确信，领土国家集中权力的趋势将导致对生活所有方面的极权主义统治。在乔治·奥威尔的《1984》（故事其实发生在 1949 年）中，『老大哥』正看着个体徒劳地挣扎，以保持一定的自主和自尊心。这似乎是一项失败的事业。弗里德里希·冯·哈耶克的《通往奴役之路》（1944 年）以更学术化的观点认为，自由正在被一种新的经济控制形式所剥夺，这种控制形式使国家成为一切的主人。这些作品都是在微处理器技术出现之前写的，微处理器技术孵化了一系列技术，提高了小团体甚至个人独立于中央权力运作的能力。</p>

        <!-- <p>As shrewd as observers like Hayek and Orwell were, they were unduly pessimistic. History has unfolded its surprises. Totalitarian Communism barely outlasted the year 1984. A new form of serfdom may yet emerge in the next millennium if governments succeed in suppressing the liberating aspects of microtechnology. But it is far more likely that we will see unprecedented opportunity and autonomy for the individual. What our parents worried about may prove to be no problem at all. What they took for granted as fixed and permanent features of social life now seem destined to disappear. Wherever necessity sets boundaries to human choice, we adjust, and reorganize our lives accordingly.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>尽管像哈耶克和奥威尔这样的观察家很精明，但他们还是过于悲观了。历史已经展现了奇迹。极权主义的共产主义几乎没有延续到 1984 年。如果政府成功地压制了微观技术的解放方面，一种新形式的农奴制可能在下一个千年出现。但更有可能的是，我们将看到前所未有的机会和个体主权。我们的父母所担心的可能被证明根本就不是问题。他们认为理所当然的社会生活的固定和永久特征现在似乎注定要消失。只要必要性为人类的选择设定了界限，我们就会进行调整，并相应地重新组织我们的生活。</p>

Most forecasts are doomed to make silly reading in the fullness of time. And the more dramatic the change they envision, the more embarrassingly wrong they tend to be. The world doesn’t end. The ozone doesn’t vanish. The coming Ice Age dissolves into global warming. Notwithstanding all the alarms to the contrary, there is still oil in the tank.

        <!-- <p>Most attempts to “unveil” the future soon turn out to be comic. Even where self-interest provides a strong incentive to clear thinking, forward vision is often myopic. In 1903, the Mercedes company said that “there would never be as many as 1 million automobiles worldwide. The reason was that it was implausible that as many as 1 million artisans worldwide would be trainable as chauffeurs.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en15" id="text00007.html#ch01en15">15</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>For centuries, the end of this millennium has been seen as a pregnant moment in history. More than 850 years ago, St. Malachy fixed 2000 as the date of the Last Judgment. American psychic Edgar Cayce said in 1934 that the earth would shift on its axis in the year 2000, causing California to split in two and inundating New York City and Japan. A Japanese rocket scientist, Hideo Itokawa, announced in 1980 that the alignment of the planets in a “Grand Cross” on August 18, 1999, would cause widespread environmental devastation, leading to the end of human life on earth.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en18" id="text00007.html#ch01en18">18</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>Such visions of apocalypse make a plump target for ridicule. After all, the year 2000, while an imposing round number, would appear to be only an arbitrary artifact of the Christian calendar as adopted in the West. Other calendars and dating systems calculate centuries and millennia from different starting points. By the reckoning of the Islamic calendar, for example, A.D . 2000 will be the year 1378. As ordinary-sounding as a year can be. According to the Chinese calendar, which repeats itself every sixty years, A.D. 2000 is just another year of the dragon. It is part of a continuous cycle that extends millennia into the past. Yet there is more than theological investment in the year 2000. Its importance is undergirded not only by Christian tradition, but by the limitations of mid-century information technology. The so-called千年虫问题or year 2000 computer problem, a potentially devastating logic flaw in billions of lines of computer code, could approximate apocalyptic conditions by closing down essential elements of industrial society on the millennial midnight. Many computers and microprocessors use software preserved and recycled from the earliest days of computers, when memory space, at $600,000 per megabyte, was more valuable than gold. To save expensive space, the early programmers tracked dates with only the last two numbers of the year. This convention of employing two-digit date fields was carried over into most software employed in mainframe computers, and even found wide use in personal computers and so-called embedded chips, microprocessors that are used to control almost everything, from VCRs to car ignition systems, security systems, telephones, the switching systems that control the telephone network, process and control systems in factories, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, pipelines and much more. Thus, abbreviated into a two-digit field, the year 1999 would be “99.” The trouble is what happens when 00 comes up for the year 2000. Many computers will read this as 1900. This may make it impossible for many unremediated computers and other digital devices to recognize the year 2000 in date fields.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <p>这种对世界末日的憧憬真是个又大又圆的调侃目标。毕竟，2000 年虽然是一个令人印象深刻的整数，但似乎只是西方采用的基督教日历的一个臆造。其他日历和测算系统从不同的起点计算几个世纪和几千年的时间。例如，根据伊斯兰历法的计算，公元 2000 年是 1378 年。2000 年将是 1378 年。听起来很普通的一个年份。根据每 60 年重复一次的中国历法，公元 2000 年只是另一个龙年。它是一个连续的周期的一部分，延伸到过去的几千年。然而，2000 年不仅仅是神学上的投资。它的重要性不仅受到基督教传统的支持，而且受到本世纪中期信息技术的限制。所谓的
            千年虫问题（
            <em>Y2K</em>）或 2000 年计算机问题，即，数十亿行计算机代码中潜在的破坏性逻辑缺陷，可以通过在千禧年的午夜关闭工业社会的基本元素来接近世界末日的条件。许多计算机和微处理器使用的是计算机早期保存和回收的软件，当时内存空间，每兆字节 60 万美元，比黄金还贵。为了节省昂贵的空间，早期的程序员只用一年的最后两个数字来追踪日期。这种采用两位数日期字段的惯例被带到了大型计算机中使用的大多数软件中，甚至在个人计算机和所谓的嵌入式芯片中广泛使用，这些微处理器被用来控制几乎所有的东西，从录像机到汽车点火系统、安全系统、电话、控制电话网络的交换系统、工厂、发电厂、炼油厂、化工厂、管道等的过程和控制系统。因此，缩写成两位数的领域，1999
            年将是『99』。问题是当『00』出现时，2000 年会发生什么。许多计算机会把它读成 1900 年。这可能会使许多未经补救的计算机和其他数字设备无法识别日期栏中的 2000 年。</p>

Embedded systems that cannot be reprogrammed but must be replaced if nonfunctional on a date-sensitive basis are found in cars, trucks, and buses built after 1976. (Perhaps you won’t be in an accident with vehicles driven by persons with noncompliant pacemakers, because their vehicles might not start.) Embedded systems are also widespread in all types of power plants, water and sewage systems, medical devices, military equipment, aircraft, offshore oil platforms, oil tankers, alarm systems, and elevators.

        <!-- <p>The large-scale command and control systems of government and major corporations that involve high transaction volumes on mainframe computers were the original focus of千年虫问题concern. Because they operate on big machines for which most software is decades old and mostly noncompliant, the original alarms about Y2K, first sounded by Peter de Jager early in the 1990s, have focused mainly on the need to upgrade operating systems for big, multiprocessing mainframes. Mr. de Jager voiced concern that there might not be enough programmers conversant with COBOL, the old mainframe language, to complete the necessary patches and repairs to date-sensitive code, even if every company and government agency with a vulnerable system had begun a crash program several years ago. Since this has not happened, and many operators of date-sensitive information systems have only just begun to assess their vulnerability, you can predict with a high degree of confidence that many mainframe systems will not be prepared to operate smoothly into the year 2000.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>政府和大公司的大型指挥和控制系统涉及大型计算机上的高交易量，是千年虫问题关注的最初焦点。因为它们在大型机器上运行，而大多数软件都是几十年前的，而且大多不符合要求，所以最初关于千年虫问题的警报，由彼得·迪·加格在二十世纪 90 年代初首次发出，主要集中在需要升级大型多处理主机的操作系统。彼得·迪·加格先生表示担心，即使每个拥有脆弱系统的公司和政府机构在几年前就开始了崩溃计划，也可能没有足够的精通 COBOL（旧的大型机语言）的程序员来完成对日期敏感代码的必要补丁和修复。由于这种情况没有发生，而且许多对日期敏感的信息系统的操作者才刚刚开始评估其脆弱性，你可以很有把握地预测，许多大型机系统将无法顺利地运行到

        <!-- <p>This is certainly a major concern because there is really no alternative to computer processing as the economy is now structured. Most businesses that are large enough to require a mainframe to handle their transactions are dependent upon transaction volumes that could not be managed with old-fashioned nineteenth-century paperwork systems.

The revenue shock from such a drop-off in business would endanger the survival of all but the most highly capitalized companies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Without electricity, even most systems that are not Y2K-impaired will not function: your refrigerator, your freezer, perhaps even your source of heat.千年虫问题compliance issues could effect safety-related access and control functions at nuclear power plants. For example, personnel at nuclear facilities wear dosimetry devices that measure the amount of radiation exposure they receive while in the plant. These devices are analyzed regularly, with the data on exposure amounts maintained on a computer system that controls personnel access to the facility. Obviously, if the controlling computers fail, they will make a hash of all the elaborate controls designed to insure safe operation and guarantee proper maintenance. But, more importantly, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission memo notes that many “non-safety-related, but important computer-based systems, primarily databases and data collection necessary for plant operations,” are date sensitive.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在你的关注清单上还有一个重要的问题，那就是如果因为与千年虫问题有关的故障而断电会发生什么。没有电，即使是大多数没有千年虫问题的系统也将无法运作：你的冰箱、你的冰柜，甚至可能是你的热源。千年虫问题可能会影响核电站与安全有关的访问和控制功能。例如，核设施的工作人员佩戴剂量测量装置，测量他们在核电站内接受的辐射量。这些装置被定期分析，暴露量的数据保存在控制人员进入设施的计算机系统中。显然，如果控制计算机发生故障，它们将使所有旨在确保安全运行和保证适当维护的精心设计的控制措施成为泡影。但是，更重要的是，核管理委员会的一份备忘录指出，许多『与安全无关但重要的基于计算机的系统，主要是工厂运营所需的数据库和数据收集』，对日期敏感。</p>

        <!-- <p>The conventional generating plants are not less vulnerable to千年虫问题disruption. For one thing, coal-powered plants are susceptible to disruptions in the surface transportation system that brings the coal to the boilers. In the 1997-1998 winter heating season, operators of coal-fired electricity generation found themselves forced to reduce output in some instances because of a slowdown in rail deliveries of Western coal arising from the merger of the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railway systems. The problem arose because of incompatibilities between the computer control and dispatch systems employed by the two railroads. According to a Union Pacific spokesman, integrating the two systems became a “nightmare,” in spite of the fact that Union Pacific Technologies has been considered an industry leader in developing computerized transportation control systems. As a result of the programming difficulties, the railroad was unable to accurately track the movements of its freight cars. The failure of Union Pacific to master the assimilation of Southern Pacific is a bad omen about what could happen when千年虫问题logic time bombs disrupt transportation, power generation, and other aspects of the economy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>传统的发电站对 2000 年问题的脆弱性并不低。首先，以煤为动力的工厂很容易受到将煤送到锅炉的地面运输系统的干扰。在 1997-1998 年冬季供暖季节，燃煤发电运营商发现自己在某些情况下被迫减少产量，因为南太平洋和联合太平洋铁路系统合并后，西部煤炭的铁路运输速度放缓。这个问题的出现是由于两家铁路公司采用的计算机控制和调度系统之间的不兼容。根据联合太平洋公司发言人的说法，尽管联合太平洋技术公司一直被认为是开发计算机化运输控制系统的行业领导者，但整合这两个系统却成为一场『噩梦』。由于编程困难，该铁路公司无法准确跟踪其货运车辆的移动。联合太平洋公司未能掌握对南太平洋公司的同化，这是一个坏兆头，说明当千年虫逻辑定时炸弹扰乱交通、发电和经济的其他方面时，可能会发生什么。</p>

        <!-- <p>The biggest worry about the electric grid, however, arises from the fact that the whole system is subject to sensitive monitoring and computer control to transfer electricity from areas of surplus generation to those with a deficit. This process must be carefully monitored by computer to prevent power surges and system failures. All the transfers of electricity are logged to time and date for duration, much like a telephone connection. While heavy-duty mechanical relays are used to make the connections, they are controlled by computer systems. These computer controls, essential for load balancing, may fail for the same reasons as the phone networks. In fact, the power load distribution-control systems in North America are networked together through T-1 lines and telephone microwave links. So if the phone network fails, you can expect the electricity to go down as well. And remember, as the experience in Canada in January 1998 confirms, once the electricity shuts down over a wide area, getting the system running again is a challenge. A blackout may last for an inconveniently long time.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>然而，对电网最大的担忧来自于这样一个事实：整个系统受到敏感的监控和计算机控制，以将电力从发电过剩的地区转移到发电不足的地区。这一过程必须由计算机仔细监控，以防止电力浪涌和系统故障。所有的电力传输都要记录下时间和日期，以确定持续时间，这与电话连接很相似。虽然重型机械继电器被用来进行连接，但它们由计算机系统控制。这些计算机控制，对于负载平衡至关重要，可能会因为与电话网络相同的原因而失败。事实上，北美的电力负荷分配控制系统是通过 T-1 线路和电话微波链接联网的。因此，如果电话网络出现故障，你可以预期电力也会瘫痪。记住，正如

In a strange way, it could complement dreams, reveries and visions, or numerical interpretations of visions, like Newton’s gloss on the prophecies of Daniel. These intuitive leaps begin with a perspective that takes the birth of Christ to be the central fact of history.

        <p>在随后的五个世纪里，经济凋零，长途贸易停滞，城市人口减少，货币从流通中消失，艺术和文化几乎殆尽。随着西方罗马帝国的崩溃，有效法律的缺失导致了更原始的解决争端的安排的出现。血仇在五世纪末开始变得重要起来。第一个有记录的神明审判事件正是发生在 500 年。</p>

        <!-- <p>Once again, a thousand years ago, the final decade of the tenth century witnessed another “tremendous upheaval in social and economic systems.” Perhaps the least known of these transitions, the feudal revolution, began at a time of utter economic and political turmoil. In <em>The Transformation of the Year One Thousand,</em>Guy Bois, a professor of medieval history at the University of Paris, claims that this rupture at the end of the tenth century involved the complete collapse of the remnants of ancient institutions, and the emergence of something new out of the anarchy—feudalism.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en23" id="text00007.html#ch01en23">23</a></sup>In the words of Raoul Glaber, “It was said that the whole world, with one accord, shook off the tatters of antiquity.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en24" id="text00007.html#ch01en24">24</a></sup>The new system that suddenly emerged accommodated the slow revival of economic growth. The five centuries now known as the Middle Ages saw a rebirth of money and international trade, along with the rediscovery of arithmetic, literacy, and time awareness.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>一千年前，第十世纪的最后十年又一次见证了『社会和经济体系的巨大动荡』。也许这些转变中最不为人知的是封建革命，它是在经济和政治彻底动荡的时候开始的。巴黎大学的中世纪历史教授盖伊·博伊斯（<em>Guy Bois</em>） 在《公元一千年的转折》中称，十世纪末的这次断裂涉及到古代制度残余的完全崩溃，以及从无政府状态 —— 封建主义中出现的新事物。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en23" id="text00007.html#ch01en23">23</a></sup>用罗杜尔弗·格莱贝尔（<em>Raoul Glaber</em>）的话说，『据说整个世界一致甩掉了古代的破烂。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en24" id="text00007.html#ch01en24">24</a></sup>突然出现的新制度适应了经济增长的缓慢复苏。在现在被称为中世纪的五个世纪里，货币和国际贸易得到了重生，同时也重新发现了算术、识字和时间意识。</p>

        <!-- <p>Then, in the final decade of the fifteenth century, there was yet another turning point. It was then that Europe emerged from the demographic deficit caused by the Black Death and almost immediately began to assert dominion over the rest of the globe. The “Gunpowder Revolution,” the “Renaissance,” and the “Reformation” are names given to different aspects of this transition that ushered in the Modern Age. It was announced with a bang when Charles VIII invaded Italy with new bronze cannon. It involved an opening to the world, epitomized by Columbus sailing to America in 1492. This opening to the New World launched a push toward the most dramatic economic growth in the experience of humanity. It involved a transformation of physics and astronomy that led to the creation of modern science. And its ideas were disseminated widely with the new technology of the printing press.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>然后，在十五世纪的最后十年，出现了另一个转折点。就在那时，欧洲摆脱了黑死病造成的人口赤字，并几乎立即开始对全球其他地区行使统治权。『火药革命』、『文艺复兴』和『宗教改革』是对这个开创现代时代的转型的不同方面的称呼。当查理八世带着新的青铜大炮入侵意大利时，它是以一声巨响宣战的。它涉及到对世界的开放，1492 年哥伦布航行到美洲就是一个缩影。这次对新世界的开放，推动了人类历史上最剧烈的经济增长。它涉及物理学和天文学的变革，导致了现代科学的产生。它的思想通过印刷术的新技术得到了广泛传播。</p>

        <!-- <p>Now we sit at the threshold of another millennial transformation. The large command and control systems inherited from the Industrial Era may break down like the one-horse shay on the stroke of the millennial midnight. Yet whether or not the Y2K problem logic bomb precipitates an immediate collapse of industrial society, its days are numbered. We expect the advent of the Information Society to utterly transform the world, in ways that this book is meant to explain. You would be perfectly within your rights to doubt this, since no cycle that repeats itself only twice in a millennium has demonstrated enough iterations to be statistically significant. Indeed, even much shorter cycles have been viewed skeptically by economists demanding more statistically satisfying proof. “Professor Dennis Robertson once wrote that we had better wait a few centuries before being sure” about the existence of four-year and eight- to ten-year trade cycles.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en25" id="text00007.html#ch01en25">25</a></sup>By that standard, Professor Robertson would have to suspend judgment for about thirty thousand years to be sure that the five-hundred-year cycle is not a statistical fluke.

        <p>现在，我们正坐在另一个千年变革的门槛上。从工业时代继承下来的大型指挥和控制系统可能会在千年的午夜时分像一架单马驱动的马车一样崩溃。然而，无论千年虫的逻辑炸弹是否会导致工业社会的立即崩溃，它的日子已经不多了。我们预计信息社会的到来将彻底改变世界，而这本书就是要解释这个问题。你完全有权利怀疑这一点，因为没有哪个周期在一千年内只重复两次乃至于已经证明有足够的迭代，且具有统计学意义。事实上，甚至更短的周期也被要求提供更多统计学上令人满意的证据，否则就会引发经济学家们的怀疑。按照这个标准，『丹尼斯·罗伯逊教授必须暂停判断大约三万年，才能确定五百年的周期不是统计上的侥幸。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch01-en25" id="text00007.html#ch01en25">25</a></sup>我们不那么教条，或者说更愿意接受暗示。我们认识到，现实的模式比大多数经济学家的静态和线性平衡模型更加复杂。</p>

        <!-- <p>We believe that the coming of the year 2000 marks more than another convenient division along an endless continuum of time. We believe it will be an inflection point between the Old World and a New World to come. The Industrial Age is rapidly passing, and its demise may, ironically, be accelerated by the fact that early computer memory was so expensive that it encouraged the widespread adoption of two-digit date fields. When Hallerith punch cards could accommodate only eighty characters each, abbreviating dates seemed a prudent thing to do. Contrary to the expectations of the early programmers, however, their abbreviation of the date field endured four decades until the end of the millennium as an accidental logic bomb that could destroy a large part of Industrial society. The U.S. government’s Office of Management and Budget described the problem in “Getting Federal Computers Ready for 2000,” a report dated February 7, 1997. The OMB concludes of computers: “Unless they are fixed or replaced, they will fail at the turn of the century in one of three ways: they will reject legitimate entries, or they will compute erroneous results, or they simply will not run.” These three outcomes in combination could cripple Industrial society. Its technology of mass production is destined to be eclipsed by a new technology of miniaturization in any event. A near-term crisis will merely accelerate the process. With the new information technology has come a new science of nonlinear dynamics, one whose startling conclusions are mere strands that have yet to be woven together into a comprehensive worldview. We live in the time of the computer, but our dreams are still spun on the loom. We continue to live by the metaphors and thoughts of industrialism. We don’t yet imagine the world in terms of strange attractors. Our politics still straddles the industrial divide between right and left, as mapped by thinkers like Adam Smith and Karl Marx, who died before almost everyone now living was born.<sup><a href="#text00007.html#ch01fn2" id="text00007.html#ch01-fn2">II</a></sup>The industrial worldview, incorporating the operating principles of industrial science, is still the “commonsense” intuition of educated opinion. It is our thesis that the “common sense” of the Industrial Age will no longer apply to many areas as the world is transformed.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们相信，2000 年的到来不仅仅是沿着无尽的时间连续体的另一个方便的划分。我们相信，这将是旧世界和即将到来的新世界之间的一个拐点。工业时代正在迅速过去，具有讽刺意味的是，它的消亡可能会因为早期计算机内存的昂贵而加速，从而鼓励人们广泛采用两位数的日期字段。当 Hallerith 打卡机只能容纳 80 个字符时，缩写日期似乎是一件很谨慎的事情。然而，与早期程序员的期望相反，他们对日期字段的缩写作为一个意外的逻辑炸弹持续了 40 年，直到千禧年的结束，这可能会摧毁工业社会的很大一部分。美国政府的管理和预算办公室在
            1997 年 2 月 7 日的报告《让联邦计算机为 2000 年做好准备》中描述了这个问题。该组织对计算机的结论是『除非它们被修复或替换，否则它们将在世纪之交以三种方式之一失败：它们将拒绝合法的条目，或它们将计算错误的结果，或它们根本不会运行。』 这三种结果结合在一起会使工业社会瘫痪。在任何情况下，它的大规模生产技术都注定要被一种新的小型化技术所取代。近期的危机只会加速这一进程。随着新的信息技术的发展，出现了一门新的非线性动力学科学，其惊人的结论仅仅是一些尚未被编织成一个全面的世界观的线索。我们生活在计算机的时代，但我们的梦想仍然在织布机上旋转。我们继续按照工业主义的隐喻和思想生活。我们还没有用奇怪的吸引力来想象这个世界。<sup><a href="#text00007.html#ch01fn2" id="text00007.html#ch01-fn2">II</a></sup>工业世界观，包含了工业科学的运作原理，仍然是受过教育的意见的『常识』直觉。我们的论点是，随着世界的转变，工业时代的『常识』将不再适用于许多领域。</p>

Indeed, the future Gibbon who chronicles the decline and fall of the once-Modern Age in the next millennium may declare that it had already ended by the time you read this book. Looking back, he may say, as we do, that it ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Or with the death of the Soviet Union in 1991.

        <!-- <p>To see “outside” an existing system is like being a stagehand trying to force a dialogue with a character in a play. It breaches a convention that helps keep the system functioning. Every social order incorporates among its key taboos the notion that people living in it should not think about how it will end and what rules may prevail in the new system that takes its place. Implicitly, whatever system exists is the last or the only system that will ever exist. Not that this is so baldly stated. Few who have ever read a history book would find such an assumption realistic if it was articulated. Nonetheless, that is the convention that rules the world. Every social system, however strongly or weakly it clings to power, pretends that its rules will never be superseded. They are the last word. Or perhaps the only word. Primitives assume that theirs is the only possible way of organizing life. More economically complicated systems that incorporate a sense of history usually place themselves at its apex. Whether they are Chinese mandarins in the court of the emperor, the Marxist nomenklatura in Stalin’s Kremlin, or members of the House of Representatives in Washington, the powers-that-be either imagine no history at all or place themselves at the pinnacle of history, in a superior position compared to everyone who came before, and the vanguard of anything to come.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>『跳出』现有系统来看问题，就像一个舞台工作人员试图强行与剧中人物对话一样。它违反了有助于维持系统运作的惯例。每一个社会秩序都包含了一个关键的禁忌，即生活在其中的人们不应该思考它将如何结束，以及在取代它的新系统中可能存在的规则。隐含的是，无论什么系统存在，都是最后的或唯一的系统，将永远存在。并且，这个观点也不会被直白地说出来。很少有读过历史书的人会认为这样的假设是现实的，如果它被阐明清楚的话。然而，这就是统治世界的惯例。每一个社会体系，无论其对权力的依附有多强或多弱，都假装其规则永远不会被取代。它们是最后一句话。或者说是唯一的说法。原始人认为他们的规则是组织生活的唯一可能方式。在经济上更复杂的系统，包含了历史感，通常将自己置于其顶点。无论他们是皇帝宫廷里的中国官吏、斯大林克里姆林宫里的马克思主义干部，还是华盛顿的众议院议员，当权者要么根本没有想象中的历史，要么将自己置于历史的顶峰，与之前的所有人相比处于优越的地位，是未来一切的先锋。</p>

        <!-- <p>This is true for practical reasons. The more apparent it is that a system is nearing an end, the more reluctant people will be to adhere to its laws. Any social organization will therefore tend to discourage or play down analyses that anticipate its demise. This alone helps ensure that history’s great transitions are seldom spotted as they happen. If you know nothing else about the future, you can rest assured that dramatic changes will be neither welcomed nor advertised by conventional thinkers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>由于实际原因，这一点是正确的。一个制度越是明显地接近尾声，人们就越是不愿意遵守它的法律。因此，任何社会组织都会倾向于阻止或淡化那些预示其灭亡的分析。仅这一点就造成了个倾向：历史上的重大转变很少在发生时被发现。如果你对未来一无所知，那么你可以放心，剧烈的变化既不会受到传统思想家的欢迎，也不会被他们宣传。</p>

The record shows that even transitions that are undeniably real in retrospect may not be acknowledged for decades or even centuries after they happen. Consider the fall of Rome. It was probably the most important historic development in the first millennium of the Christian era. Yet long after Rome’s demise, the fiction that it survived was held out to public view, like Lenin’s embalmed corpse.

        <!-- <p>The reason was not merely the inadequacy of communications in the ancient world. The outcome would have been much the same had CNN miraculously been in business, running its videotape in September 476. That is when the last Roman emperor in the West, Romulus Augustulus, was captured in Ravenna and forcibly retired to a villa in Campania on a pension. Even if Wolfe Blitzer had been there with minicams recording the news in 476, it is unlikely that he or anyone else would have dared to characterize those events as marking the end of the Roman Empire. That, of course, is exactly what latter historians said happened.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>原因不仅仅在于古代世界的通讯不发达。如果美国有线电视新闻网奇迹般地在 476 年 9 月开始营业，有录像带可用，结果也会大致相同。那时候，西方最后一位罗马皇帝罗慕路斯·奥古斯都鲁斯在拉文纳被俘，被迫退居到坎帕尼亚的一座别墅里领取退休金。即使沃尔夫·布利策在 476 年用微型摄像机记录了新闻，他或其他人也不可能敢把这些事件定性为标志着罗马帝国的结束。当然，这正是后世历史学家所说的情况。</p>

        <!-- <p>CNN editors probably would not have approved a headline story saying “Rome fell this evening.” The powers-that-be denied that Rome had fallen. Peddlers of “news” seldom are partisans of controversy in ways that would undermine their own profits. They may be partisan. They may even be outrageously so. But they seldom report conclusions that would convince subscribers to cancel their subscriptions and head for the hills. Which is why few would have reported the fall of Rome even if it had been technologically possible. Experts would have come forth to say that it was ridiculous to speak of Rome falling. To have said otherwise would have been bad for business and, perhaps, bad for the health of those doing the reporting.

        <p>CNN 的编辑们可能不会批准『罗马今天晚上灭亡』的标题报道。当权者否认了罗马已经灭亡的说法。兜售『新闻』的人很少会以损害自己利益的方式参与争论。他们可能是党派人士。他们甚至可能是离谱的。但他们很少报道会说服订户取消订阅并从此走进山林躲避乱世的结论。这就是为什么即使在技术上有可能，也很少有人会报道罗马的灭亡。专家们会站出来说，谈论罗马的衰落是荒谬的。如果不这样说，就会对生意不利，也许对报道者的健康不利。五世纪末的罗马的势力是野蛮人，他们否认罗马已经灭亡。</p>

        <!-- <p>But it was not merely a case of authorities’ saying, “Don’t report this or we will kill you.” Part of the problem was that Rome was already so degenerate by the later decades of the fifth century that its “fall” genuinely eluded the notice of most people who lived through it. In fact, it was a generation later before Count Marcellinus first suggested that “The Western Roman Empire perished with this Augustulus.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en4" id="text00008.html#ch02en4">4</a></sup>Many more decades passed, perhaps centuries, before there was a common acknowledgment that the Roman Empire in the West no longer existed. Certainly Charlemagne believed that he was a legitimate Roman emperor in the year 800.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>但是，这不仅仅是当局说『不要报道这个，否则我们会杀了你』的情况。问题的一部分在于，罗马在五世纪后期已经如此堕落，以至于它的『堕落』真正避开了大多数经历过它的人的注意。事实上，在一代人之后，马塞利努斯伯爵才第一次提出：『西罗马帝国与这个奥古斯都勒斯一起灭亡了。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en4" id="text00008.html#ch02en4">4</a></sup>又过了几十年，也许几个世纪，人们才普遍承认，西方的罗马帝国已经不存在了。当然，查理曼认为他在
            800 年时是一个合法的罗马皇帝。</p>

        <!-- <p>The point is not that Charlemagne and all who thought in conventional terms about the Roman Empire after 476 were fools. To the contrary. The characterization of social developments is frequently ambiguous. When the power of predominant institutions is brought into the bargain to reinforce a convenient conclusion, even one based largely on pretense, only someone of strong character and strong opinions would dare contradict it. If you try to put yourself in the position of a Roman of the late fifth century, it is easy to imagine how tempting it would have been to conclude that nothing had changed. That certainly was the optimistic conclusion. To have thought otherwise might have been frightening. And why come to a frightening conclusion when a reassuring one was at hand?</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>重点不是说查理曼大帝和所有在 476 年后以传统方式思考罗马帝国的人是傻瓜。恰恰相反。社会发展的特征经常是模糊不清的。当占主导地位的机构的力量被带入交易，以加强一个方便的结论，甚至是一个主要基于伪装的结论时，只有性格强硬和意见强烈的人才敢于反驳它。如果你试着把自己放在五世纪末的罗马人的位置上，就很容易想象得出没有任何变化的结论会是多么诱人。这当然是一个乐观的结论。如果不这样想，可能会让人感到害怕。而当一个令人放心的结论就在眼前时，为什么还要得出一个令人恐惧的结论呢？</p>

        <!-- <p>After all, a case could have been made that business would continue as usual. It had in the past.

His departure might have seemed no different to his contemporaries than many other upheavals in a chaotic time. And he was sent packing with a pension. The very fact that he received a pension, even for a brief period before he was murdered, was a reassurance that the system survived. To an optimist, Odoacer, who deposed Romulus Augustulus, reunified rather than destroyed the empire. A son of Attila’s sidekick Edecon, Odoacer was a clever man. He did not proclaim himself emperor. Instead, he convened the Senate and prevailed upon its too-suggestible members that they offer the emperorship and thus sovereignty over the whole empire to Zeno, the Eastern emperor in faraway Byzantium. Odoacer was merely to be Zeno’s <em>patricius</em>to govern Italy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <p>有很多理由让我们认真思考罗马的衰落这个遥远的例子，尤其是当你思考当今世界状况的时候。大多数关于未来的书实际上是关于现在的书。我们试图弥补这一缺陷，使这本关于未来的书首先成为一本关于过去的书。我们认为，如果我们用过去的真实例子来说明关于暴力逻辑的重要的跨政治观点，你就有可能对未来的情况有更准确的看法。历史是一个神奇的老师。它所讲述的故事比我们所能编造的任何故事都要有趣。而许多更有趣的故事都与罗马的灭亡有关。它们记录了可能与你在信息时代的未来有关的重要教训。</p>

        <!-- <p>First of all, the fall of Rome is one of history’s more vivid examples of what happened in a major transition when the scale of government was collapsing. The transitions of the year 1000 also involved the collapse of central authority, and did so in a way that increased the complexity and scope of economic activity. The Gunpowder Revolution at the end of the fifteenth century involved major changes in institutions that tended to raise rather than shrink the scale of governance. Today, for the first time in a thousand years, megapolitical conditions in the West are undermining and destroying governments, corporate conglomerates, labor unions, and many other institutions that operate on a large scale.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>首先，罗马的衰落是历史上更生动的例子之一，说明了在政府规模崩溃的重大转型中所发生的事情。1000 年的转型也涉及中央权力的崩溃，而且是以增加经济活动的复杂性和范围的方式进行的。十五世纪末的火药革命涉及机构的重大变化，这些变化倾向于提高而不是缩小治理的规模。今天，一千年来第一次，西方的『跨政治』状况正在破坏和摧毁政府、企业集团、工会和许多其他大规模运作的机构。</p>

        <!-- <p>Of course, the collapse in the scale of governance at the end of the Roman Empire had very different causes from those prevailing now, at the advent of the Information Age. Part of the reason that Rome fell is simply that it had expanded beyond the scale at which the economies of violence could be maintained. The cost of garrisoning the empire’s far-flung borders exceeded the economic advantages that an ancient agricultural economy could support. The burden of taxation and regulation required to finance the military effort rose to exceed the carrying capacity of the economy. Corruption became endemic. A large part of the effort of military commanders, as historian Ramsay MacMullen has documented, was devoted to pursuit of “illicit profits of their command.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en13" id="text00008.html#ch02en13">13</a></sup>This they pursued by shaking down the population, what the fourth-century observer Synesius described as “the peace-time war, one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from the military’s indiscipline and the officers’ greed.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en14" id="text00008.html#ch02en14">14</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当然，罗马帝国末期治理规模的崩溃，与现在信息时代到来时的普遍原因有很大不同。罗马之所以灭亡，部分原因是它的扩张超出了暴力经济可以维持的规模。驻守帝国遥远边界的成本超过了古代农业经济所能支持的经济优势。为军事努力提供资金所需的税收和监管负担上升到超过经济的承载能力。腐败成为普遍现象。正如历史学家拉姆斯·麦克马伦（<em>Ramsay MacMullen</em>）所记录的那样，军事指挥官的很大一部分努力都是为了追求『其指挥的非法利润』。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en13" id="text00008.html#ch02en13">13</a></sup>他们通过震慑民众来追求这一目标，即第四世纪的观察家
            Synesius 所描述的『和平时期的战争』，一个几乎比野蛮人的战争更糟糕的战争，由军队的无纪律性和官员的贪婪所引起。</p>

        <!-- <p>Another important contributing factor to Rome’s collapse was a demographic deficit caused by the Antonine plagues. The collapse of the Roman population in many areas obviously contributed to economic and military weakness. Nothing of that kind has happened today, at least not yet. Taking a longer view, perhaps, the scourge of new “plagues” will compound the challenges of technological devolution in the new millennium. The unprecedented bulge in human population in the twentieth century creates a tempting target for rapidly mutating microparasites. Fears about the Ebola virus, or something like it, invading metropolitan populations may be well founded. But this is not the place to consider the coevolution of humans and diseases. As interesting a topic as that is, our argument at this juncture is not about why Rome fell, or even about whether the world today is vulnerable to some of the same influences that contributed to Roman decline. It is about something different—namely, the way that history’s great transformations are perceived, or rather, misperceived as they happen.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>罗马崩溃的另一个重要因素是安东瘟疫造成的人口赤字。罗马人口在许多地区的崩溃显然导致了经济和军事上的虚弱。今天还没有发生这样的事情，至少还没有。从更长远的角度来看，也许新的『瘟疫』的祸害将加剧新千年技术转移的挑战。二十世纪人类人口的空前膨胀为快速变异的微型寄生虫创造了一个诱人的目标。对埃博拉病毒或类似病毒入侵大都市人口的担忧可能是有道理的。但这里不是考虑人类和疾病的共同进化的地方。尽管这是个有趣的话题，但我们在这个时刻的争论不是关于罗马为什么会衰落，甚至不是关于今天的世界是否容易受到一些导致罗马衰落的相同影响。它是关于一些不同的东西
            —— 即，历史上的伟大变革被感知的方式，或者说，在它们发生时被误解的方式。</p>

        <!-- <p>People are always and everywhere to some degree conservative, with a small “c.” That implies a reluctance to think in terms of dissolving venerable social conventions, overturning the accepted institutions, and defying the laws and values from which they drew their bearings. Few are inclined to imagine that apparently minor changes in climate or technology or some other variable can somehow be responsible for severing connections to the world of their fathers. The Romans were reluctant to acknowledge the changes unfolding around them. So are we.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在某种程度上，人们总是也到处都是保守的，虽然谈不上都是保守主义者。这意味着人们不愿意从解散可敬的社会习俗、颠覆公认的制度、违抗他们赖以生存的法律和价值观的角度来思考问题。很少有人倾向于想象，气候、技术或其他一些变量的明显细微变化会以某种方式切断与他们父辈世界的联系。罗马人不愿意承认他们周围正在发生的变化。我们也是如此。</p>

        <!-- <p>Yet recognize it or not, we are living through a change of historical season, a transformation in the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves that is so far-reaching that it will inevitably transform the whole of society. The change will be so profound, in fact, that to understand it will require taking almost nothing for granted. You will be invited at almost every turn to believe that the coming Information Societies will be very like the industrial society you grew up in. We doubt it. Microprocessing will dissolve the mortar in the bricks. It will so profoundly alter the logic of violence that it will inevitably change the way people organize their livelihoods and defend themselves. Yet the tendency will be to downplay the inevitability of these changes, or to argue about their desirability as if it were within the fiat of industrial institutions to determine how history evolves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>然而，不管你是否承认，我们正在经历一场历史性的变革，一场人们组织生计和保护自己的方式的变革，其意义如此深远，将不可避免地改变整个社会。事实上，这种变化将是如此深刻，以至于要理解它，几乎不能要把任何事情视为理所当然。几乎每一次都会有人请你相信，即将到来的信息社会将非常像你成长的工业社会。我们对此表示怀疑。微处理器将使砖块中的砂浆溶解。它将如此深刻地改变暴力的逻辑，以至于它将不可避免地改变人们组织其生计和保护自己的方式。然而，人们倾向于淡化这些变化的必然性，或者争论这些变化的可取性，仿佛决定历史如何演变的是工业机构的命令。</p>

        <h3>大幻觉</h3>

        <!-- <p>Authors who are in many ways better informed than we are will nevertheless lead you astray in thinking about the future because they are far too superficial in examining how societies work. For example, David Kline and Daniel Burstein have written a well-researched volume entitled <em>Road Warriors: Dreams and Nightmares Along the Information Highway.</em>It is full of admirable detail, but much of this detail is marshaled in arguing an illusion, the idea “that citizens can act together, consciously, to shape the spontaneous economic and natural processes going on around them.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en15" id="text00008.html#ch02en15">15</a></sup>Although it may not be obvious, this is equivalent to saying that feudalism might have survived if everyone had rededicated himself to chivalry. No one in a court of the late fifteenth century would have objected to such a sentiment. Indeed, it would have been heresy to do so. But it also would have been entirely misleading, an example of the snake trying to fit the future into its old skin.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在许多方面比我们更了解情况的作者，却会在思考未来时将你引入歧途，因为他们在研究社会如何运作时过于肤浅。例如，大卫·克莱恩（<em>David Kline</em>）和丹尼尔·伯斯汀（<em>Daniel Burstein</em>）写了一本经过深入研究的书，题为《公路武士》（<em>Road Warriors</em>）。它充满了令人钦佩的细节，但这些细节大部分都被用来论证一种幻觉，即『公民可以有意识地一起行动，以塑造他们周围自发的经济和自然进程』的想法。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en15" id="text00008.html#ch02en15">15</a></sup>虽然可能不明显，但这相当于说，如果每个人都重新献身于骑士精神，封建主义就有可能生存下去。在十五世纪末的法庭上，没有人会反对这种观点。但这也完全是一种误导，是蛇试图把未来装进它的旧皮囊的一个例子。</p>

        <!-- <p>The basic causes of change are precisely those that are not subject to conscious control. They are the factors that alter the conditions under which violence pays. Indeed, they are so remote from any obvious means of manipulation that they are not even subjects of political maneuvering in a world saturated with politics. No one ever marched in a demonstration shouting, “Increase scale economies in the production process.” No banner has ever demanded, “Invent a weapons system that increases the importance of the infantry.” No candidate ever promised to “alter the balance between efficiency and magnitude in protection against violence.” Such slogans would be ridiculous, precisely because their goals are beyond the capacity of anyone to consciously affect. Yet as we will explore, these variables determine how the world works to a far greater degree than any political platform.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>变化的基本原因正是那些不受意识控制的因素。它们是改变暴力支付条件的因素。事实上，它们与任何明显的操纵手段相距甚远，以至于在一个充满政治的世界中，它们甚至不是政治操纵的对象。从来没有人在游行中高喊：『提高生产过程中的规模经济』。从来没有人打着横幅要求：『发明一种武器系统，提高步兵的重要性』。从未有候选人承诺『改变保护暴力的效率和规模之间的平衡』。这样的口号将是荒谬的，正是因为它们的目标是任何人都无法有意识地影响的。然而，正如我们将探讨的那样，这些变量决定了世界如何运作，其程度远远超过任何政治纲领。</p>

        <!-- <p>If you think about it carefully, it should be obvious that important transitions in history seldom are driven primarily by human wishes. They do not happen because people get fed up with one way of life and suddenly prefer another. A moment’s reflection suggests why. If what people think and desire were the only determinants of what happens, then all the abrupt changes in history would have to be explained by wild mood swings unconnected to any change in the actual conditions of life. In fact, this never happens. Only in cases of medical problems affecting a few people do we see arbitrary fluctuations in mood that appear entirely divorced from any objective cause.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>如果你仔细想一想，应该很明显，历史上的重要转变很少主要由人类的愿望驱动。它们的发生并不是因为人们厌倦了一种生活方式而突然喜欢上另一种生活方式。稍微思考一下就可以知道原因。如果人们的想法和愿望是所发生事情的唯一决定因素，那么历史上所有的突然变化都将不得不被解释为与实际生活条件的任何变化毫无关联的情绪波动。事实上，这种情况从未发生过。只有在影响到少数人的医疗问题的情况下，我们才会看到情绪的任意波动，似乎完全脱离了任何客观原因。</p>

        <!-- <p>As a rule, large numbers of people do not suddenly and all at once decide to abandon their way of life simply because they find it amusing to do so. No forager ever said, “I am tired of living in prehistoric times, I would prefer the life of a peasant in a farming village.” Any decisive swing in patterns of behavior and values is invariably a response to an actual change in the conditions of life. In this sense, at least, people are always realistic. If their views do change abruptly, it probably indicates that they have been confronted by some departure from familiar conditions: an invasion, a plague, a sudden climatic shift, or a technological revolution that alters their livelihoods or their ability to defend themselves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>一般来说，大量的人不会突然一下子决定放弃他们的生活方式，仅仅是因为他们觉得这样做很有趣。从来没有一个觅食者说：『我已经厌倦了生活在史前时代，我更愿意过农耕村的农民生活』。行为模式和价值观念的任何决定性摇摆无一例外地是对生活条件的实际变化的反应。至少在这个意义上，人们总是现实的。如果他们的观点确实发生了突变，这可能表明他们遇到了一些与熟悉的条件不同的情况：入侵、瘟疫、气候突变或技术革命，改变了他们的生计或自卫能力。</p>

        <!-- <p>Far from being the product of human desire, decisive historic changes more often than not confound the wish of most people for stability. When change occurs, it typically causes widespread disorientation, especially among those who lose income or social status. You will look in vain at public opinion polls or other measures of mood for an understanding of how the coming megapolitical transition is likely to unfold.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>决定性的历史变革远非人类欲望的产物，它往往会使大多数人对稳定的愿望感到困惑。当变化发生时，它通常会引起广泛的迷失，特别是在那些失去收入或社会地位的人中。你将会徒劳地从民意调查或其他情绪措施中了解即将到来的跨政治过渡可能会如何展开。</p>

Indeed, no one could have foreseen much of anything beyond where to find the next meal. When farming began, there was no record of past events from which to draw perspective on the future. There was not even a Western sense of time divided into orderly units, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, and so on, to measure out the years. Foragers lived in the “eternal present,” without calendars, and indeed, without written records at all. They had no science, and no other intellectual apparatus for understanding cause and effect beyond their own intuitions. When it came to looking ahead, our primeval ancestors were blind. To cite the biblical metaphor, they had not yet eaten of the fruit of knowledge.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Science and mathematics have helped unlock many of nature’s secrets, giving us an understanding of cause and effect that approaches the magical when compared to that of the early foragers. Computational algorithms developed as a result of high-speed computers have shed new insights on the workings of complex, dynamic systems like the human economy. The painstaking development of political economy itself, although it falls well short of perfection, has honed understanding of the factors informing human action. Important among these is the recognition that people at all times and places tend to respond to incentives. Not always as mechanically as economists imagine, but they do respond. Costs and rewards matter. Changes in external conditions that raise the rewards or lower the costs of certain behavior will lead to more of that behavior, other things being-equal.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

This is not as trivial as it seems. It shows why the clever people who say that forecasting is impossible are wrong. Any forecast that accurately anticipates the impact of incentives on behavior is likely to be broadly correct. And the greater the anticipated change in costs and rewards, the less trivial the implied forecast is likely to be.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>人们倾向于对成本和奖励做出反应，这是预测的一个基本要素。你可以很有把握地说，如果你在街上扔下一张百元大钞，不管你是在纽约、墨西哥城还是莫斯科，很快就会有人捡到它。这并不像它看起来那样微不足道。它说明了为什么那些说预测是不可能的聪明人是错误的。任何准确预测激励措施对行为的影响的预测都可能是广泛正确的。而且，预期的成本和回报的变化越大，隐含的预测就越不简单。</p>

        <!-- <p>The most far-reaching forecasts of all are likely to arise from recognizing the implications of shifting megapolitical variables. Violence is the ultimate boundary force on behavior; thus, if you can understand how the logic of violence will change, you can usefully predict where people will be dropping or picking up the equivalent of one-hundred-dollar bills in the future.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

We cannot predict the coming of a new Ice Age, a sudden volcanic eruption, or the emergence of a new disease. The number of unknowable events that could alter the course of history is large. But knowing the unknowable is very different from drawing out the implications of what is already known. If you see a flash of lightning far away, you can forecast with a high degree of confidence that a thunderclap is due. Forecasting the consequences of megapolitical transitions involves much longer time frames, and less certain connections, but it is a similar kind of exercise.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>This chapter analyzes some of the common features of megapolitical transitions. In following chapters we look more closely at the Agricultural Revolution, and the transition from farm to factory, the second of the previous great phase changes. Within the agricultural stage of civilization there were many minor megapolitical transitions such as the fall of Rome and the feudal revolution of the year 1000. These marked the waxing and waning of the power equation as governments rose and fell and the spoils of farming passed from one set of hands to another. The owners of sprawling estates under the Roman Empire, yeoman farmers in the European Dark Ages, and the lords and serfs of the feudal period all ate grain from the same fields. They lived under very different governments because of the cumulative impact of different technologies, fluctuations in climate, and the disruptive influences of disease.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>本章分析了『跨政治』过渡的一些共同特征。在接下来的章节中，我们将更仔细地研究农业革命，以及从农场到工厂的过渡，这是之前大阶段变化中的第二个。在文明的农业阶段，有许多小的跨政治过渡，如罗马的衰落和 1000 年的封建革命。这些标志着权力等式的消长，因为政府的兴衰和农业的战利品从一个人手中转移到另一个人手中。罗马帝国时期庞大的庄园主，欧洲暗黑时代的贵族农民，以及封建时期的领主和农奴，都吃着同样田地里的粮食。只是由于不同技术的累积影响、气候的波动和疾病的破坏性影响，他们生活在非常不同的政府之下。</p>

        <!-- <p>Our purpose is not to thoroughly explain all of these changes. We do not pretend to do so, although we have sketched out some illustrations of the way that changing megapolitical variables have altered the way that power was exercised in the past. Governments have grown and shrunk as megapolitical fluctuations have lowered and raised the costs of projecting power.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们的目的不是要彻底解释所有这些变化。我们并不打算这样做，尽管我们已经勾勒出一些例子，说明不断变化的跨政治变量是如何改变过去行使权力的方式的。由于跨政治波动降低和提高了投射权力的成本，政府也随之增长和萎缩。</p>

        <!-- <p>The concept of megapolitics is a powerful one. It helps illuminate some of the major mysteries of history: how governments rise and fall and what types of institutions they become; the timing and outcome of wars; patterns of economic prosperity and decline. By raising or lowering the costs and rewards of projecting power, megapolitics governs the ability of people to impose their will on others. This has been true from the earliest human societies onward. It still is. We explored many of the important hidden megapolitical factors that determine the evolution of history in <em>Blood in the Streets</em>and <em>The Great Reckoning.</em>The key to unlocking the implications of megapolitical change is understanding the factors that precipitate revolutions in the use of violence. These variables can be somewhat arbitrarily grouped into four categories: topography, climate, microbes, and technology.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>『跨政治』的概念是一个强有力的概念。它有助于阐明历史上的一些主要谜团：政府如何兴衰以及它们成为何种类型的机构；战争的时间和结果；经济繁荣和衰退的模式。通过提高或降低投射权力的成本和回报，『跨政治』控制着人们将自己的意志强加于人的能力。从最早的人类社会开始，这就是事实。现在也是如此。我们在《血流成河》和《大清算》中探讨了许多决定历史演变的重要的隐性跨政治因素。解开跨政治变化的影响的关键是了解在使用暴力方面促成革命的因素。这些变量可以在某种程度上被任意地归为四类：地形、气候、微生物和技术。</p>

        <!-- <p>1. <strong>Topography</strong>is a crucial factor, as evidenced by the fact that control of violence on the open seas has never been monopolized as it has on land. No government’s laws have ever exclusively applied there. This is a matter of the utmost importance in understanding how the organization of violence and protection will evolve as the economy migrates into cyberspace.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>1. <strong>地形</strong>是一个至关重要的因素，这一点从公海上的暴力控制从未像陆地上那样被垄断的事实中可以看出。没有任何一个政府的法律在那里专门适用。这是一个极其重要的问题，有助于理解随着经济向网络空间的迁移，暴力和保护的组织将如何演变。</p>

        <!-- <p>Topography, in conjunction with climate, had a major role to play in early history. The first states emerged on floodplains, surrounded by desert, such as in Mesopotamia and Egypt, where water for irrigation was plentiful but surrounding regions were too dry to support yeoman farming. Under such conditions, individual farmers faced a very high cost for failing to cooperate in maintaining the political structure. Without irrigation, which could be provided only on a large scale, crops would not grow. No crops meant starvation. The conditions that placed those who controlled the water in a desert in a position of strength made for despotic and rich government.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p><strong>地形</strong>与气候相结合，在早期历史中发挥了重要作用。第一批国家出现在被沙漠包围的洪泛区，如美索不达米亚和埃及，那里有丰富的灌溉用水，但周围地区过于干燥，无法支持贵族耕作。在这种情况下，单个农民如果不合作维持政治结构，就会面临非常高的成本。没有灌溉，只有大规模的灌溉，作物就不会生长。没有农作物就意味着饥饿。将沙漠中控制水的人置于强势地位的条件，使得政府变得专制而富有。</p>

        <!-- <p>As we analyzed in <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>topographic conditions also played a major role in the prosperity of yeoman farmers in ancient Greece, enabling that region to become the cradle of Western democracy. Given the primitive transportation conditions prevailing in the Mediterranean region three thousand years ago, it was all but impossible for persons living more than a few miles from the sea to compete in the production of high-value crops of the ancient world, olives and grapes. If the oil and the wine had to be transported any distance overland, the portage costs were so great that they could not be sold at a profit. The elaborate shoreline of the Greek littoral meant that most areas of Greece were no more than twenty miles from the sea. This gave a decisive advantage to Greek farmers over their potential competitors in landlocked areas.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>正如我们在《大清算》中分析的那样，<strong>地形条件</strong>在古希腊的贵族农民的繁荣中也发挥了重要作用，使该地区成为西方民主的摇篮。鉴于三千年前地中海地区普遍存在的原始交通条件，生活在离海几英里以外的人几乎不可能在古代世界的高价值作物 —— 橄榄和葡萄的生产中与其竞争。如果石油和葡萄酒必须通过陆路运输，搬运费用是如此之大，以至于它们无法获得利润。希腊沿岸由大自然精心设计的海岸线意味着希腊的大部分地区离海不超过 20 英里。这给希腊农民带来了决定性的优势，使他们比内陆地区的潜在竞争对手更有优势。</p>

        <!-- <p>Because of this advantage in trading high-value products, Greek farmers earned high incomes from control of only small parcels of land. These high incomes enabled them to purchase costly armor. The famous hoplites of ancient Greece were farmers or landlords who armed themselves at their own expense. Both well armed and well motivated, the Greek hoplites were militarily formidable and could not be ignored. Topographic conditions were the foundation of Greek democracy, just as those of a different kind gave rise to the Oriental despotisms of Eygpt and elsewhere.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>由于在高价值产品贸易方面的这种优势，希腊农民仅通过控制小块土地就获得了高收入。这些高收入使他们能够购买昂贵的盔甲。古希腊著名的重装步兵是自费武装自己的农民或地主。希腊的重装步兵武器精良，斗志昂扬，在军事上非常强大，不容忽视。地形条件是希腊民主的基础，就像那些不同类型的条件产生了位于它东方的埃及和其他地方的专制制度一样。</p>

        <!-- <p>2. <strong>Climate</strong>also helps set the boundaries within which brute force can be exercised. A climatic change was the catalyst for the first major transition from foraging to farming. The end of the last Ice Age, about thirteen thousand years ago, led to a radical alteration in vegetation. Beginning in the Near East, where the Ice Age retreated first, a gradual rise in temperature and rainfall spread forests into areas that had previously been grasslands. In particular, the rapid spread of beech forests seriously curtailed the human diet. As Susan Ailing Gregg put it in <em>Foragers and Farmers:</em></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>2. <strong>气候</strong>也有助于设定可以行使野蛮暴力的界限。气候的变化是第一次从觅食到耕作的重大转变的催化剂。大约 1.3 万年前最后一个冰河时期的结束，导致了植被的彻底改变。从冰河时代首先退去的近东开始，温度和降雨量的逐渐上升使森林蔓延到以前是草原的地区。特别是，山毛榉森林的迅速蔓延严重限制了人类的饮食。正如苏珊·艾林·格雷格在《觅食者与农民》中所说：</p>

        <!-- <blockquote><span class="english"></span> -->
        <blockquote>

            <!-- <p>The establishment of beech forests must have had serious consequences for local human, plant and animal populations. The canopy of an oak forest is relatively open and allows large amounts of sunlight to reach the forest floor. An exuberant undergrowth of mixed shrubs, forbs, and grasses develops, and the diversity of plants supports a variety of wildlife. In contrast, the canopy of a beech forest is closed and the forest floor is heavily shaded. Other than a flush of spring annuals prior to the emergence of the leaves, only shade-tolerant sedges, ferns, and a few grasses are found.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en18" id="text00008.html#ch02en18">18</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>山毛榉森林的建立肯定对当地的人类、植物和动物种群产生了严重影响。橡树林的树冠是相对开放的，允许大量的阳光照射到林地。由混合灌木、草本植物和草组成的茂盛的灌木丛发展起来，植物的多样性支持各种野生动物。与此相反，山毛榉森林的树冠是封闭的，森林底部被严重遮蔽。除了在树叶出现之前的春季一年生植物群落外，只发现耐阴的沉香、蕨类和少数草类。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en18" id="text00008.html#ch02en18">18</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Over time, dense forests encroached on the open plains, spreading throughout Europe into the Eastern steppes.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en19" id="text00008.html#ch02en19">19</a></sup>The forests reduced the grazing area available to support large animals, making it increasingly difficult for the population of human foragers to support themselves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>The population of hunter-gatherers had swollen too greatly during the Ice Age prosperity to support itself on the dwindling herds of large mammals, many species of which were hunted to extinction. The transition to agriculture was not a choice of preference, but an improvisation adopted under duress to make up for shortfalls in the diet. Foraging continued to predominate in those areas farther north, where the warming trend had not adversely affected the habitats of large mammals, and in tropical rainforests, where the global warming trend did not have the perverse effect of reducing food supplies. Since the advent of farming, it has been far more common for changes to be precipitated by the cooling rather than the warming of the climate.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>狩猎采集者的人口在冰河时代的繁荣中膨胀得太厉害，无法靠日益减少的大型哺乳动物群来养活自己，其中许多物种被猎杀到灭绝。向农业的过渡并不是一种选择，而是在被迫的情况下为弥补饮食的不足而采取的一种临时措施。在那些较远的北方地区和热带雨林中，觅食仍然占主导地位，因为那里的变暖趋势没有对大型哺乳动物的栖息地产生不利影响，而且全球变暖趋势也没有产生减少食物供应的反作用。自农业出现以来，由气候变冷而不是变暖引发的变化更为常见。</p>

        <!-- <p>A modest understanding of the dynamics of climatic change in past societies could well prove useful in the event that climates continue to fluctuate. If you know that a drop of one degree Centigrade on average reduces the growing season by three to four weeks and shaves five hundred feet off the maximum elevation at which crops can be grown, then you know something about the boundary conditions that will confine people’s action in the future.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en20" id="text00008.html#ch02en20">20</a></sup>You can use this knowledge to forecast changes in everything from grain prices to land values. You may even be able to draw informed conclusions about the likely impact of falling temperatures on real incomes and political stability. In the past, governments have been overthrown when crop failures extending over several years raised food prices and shrank disposable incomes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>对过去社会的气候变化动态的适度了解，在气候继续波动的情况下很可能证明是有用的。如果你知道平均下降一摄氏度会使生长季节减少三到四个星期，并使可种植作物的最高海拔减少五百英尺，那么你就知道了一些限制人们未来行动的边界条件。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en20" id="text00008.html#ch02en20">20</a></sup>你可以利用这些知识来预测从谷物价格到土地价值的一切变化。你甚至可以就气温下降对实际收入和政治稳定的可能影响得出明智的结论。在过去，当农作物歉收持续数年，导致食品价格上涨和可支配收入缩水时，政府就会被推翻。</p>

        <!-- <p>For example, it is no coincidence that the seventeenth century, the coldest in the modern period, was also a period of revolution worldwide. A hidden megapolitical cause of this unhappiness was sharply colder weather. It was so cold, in fact, that wine froze on the “Sun King’s” table at Versailles. Shortened growing seasons produced crop failures and undermined real income. Because of the colder weather, prosperity began to wind down into a long global depression that began around 1620. It proved drastically destabilizing. The economic crisis of the seventeenth century led to the world being overwhelmed by rebellions, many clustering in 1648, exactly two hundred years before another and more famous cycle of rebellions. Between 1640 and 1650, there were rebellions in Ireland, Scotland, England, Portugal, Catalonia, France, Moscow, Naples, Sicily, Brazil, Bohemia, Ukraine, Austria, Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Even China and Japan were swept with unrest.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>例如，近代以来最冷的十七世纪也是全世界革命的时期，这并非巧合。造成这种不愉快的一个隐藏的跨政治原因是天气急剧变冷。事实上，天气是如此寒冷，以至于凡尔赛的『太阳王』桌上的酒都冻住了。生长季节的缩短导致作物歉收，并破坏了实际收入。由于天气变冷，繁荣开始进入漫长的全球大萧条，大约从 1620 年开始。事实证明，它极大地破坏了稳定。十七世纪的经济危机导致世界被叛乱所淹没，许多叛乱集中在 1648 年，正好在另一个更著名的叛乱周期的两百年前。1640 年至 1650 年间，爱尔兰、苏格兰、英格兰、葡萄牙、加泰罗尼亚、法国、莫斯科、那不勒斯、西西里、巴西、波西米亚、乌克兰、奥地利、波兰、瑞典、荷兰和土耳其都发生了叛乱。甚至中国和日本也被动乱所席卷。</p>

        <!-- <p>It may also be no coincidence that mercantilism predominated in the seventeenth century during a period of shrinking trade. Economic closure was perhaps most pronounced at the end of the century, “when a terrible famine occurred.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en21" id="text00008.html#ch02en21">21</a></sup>By the eighteenth century, especially after 1750, warmer temperatures and higher crop yields had begun to raise real incomes in Western Europe sufficiently to expand demand for manufactured goods. More free-market policies were adopted. This led to a self-reinforcing burst of economic growth as industry expanded to a larger scale in what is commonly described as the Industrial Revolution. The growing importance of technology and manufactured output reduced the impact of the weather on economic cycles.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>重商主义在十七世纪贸易萎缩时期占主导地位，这可能也不是巧合。经济封闭也许在该世纪末最为明显，「当时发生了可怕的饥荒。」<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en21" id="text00008.html#ch02en21">21</a></sup>到了十八世纪，特别是 1750 年以后，气温升高，作物产量提高，西欧的实际收入开始提高，足以扩大对工业品的需求。更多的自由市场政策被采纳。这导致了经济增长的自我强化，因为工业扩展到更大的规模，这就是通常所说的工业革命。技术和制成品的重要性日益增加，减少了天气对经济周期的影响。</p>

        <!-- <p>Even today, however, you should not underestimate the impact of suddenly colder weather in lowering real incomes—even in wealthy regions such as North America. There is a strong tendency for societies to render themselves crisis-prone when the existing configuration of institutions has exhausted its potential. In the past, this tendency has often been manifested by population increases that stretched the carrying capacity of land to the limit. This happened both before the transition of the year 1000 and again at the end of the fifteenth century. The plunge in real income caused by crop failures and lower yields played a significant role in both instances in destroying the predominant institutions. Today the marginalization is manifested in the consumer credit markets. If sharply colder weather reduced crop yields and lowered disposable incomes, this would lead to debt default as well as tax rebellions. If the past is a guide, both economic closure and political instability could result.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>然而，即使在今天，你也不应该低估突然变冷的天气对降低实际收入的影响 —— 即使是在北美这样的富裕地区。当现有的机构配置已经耗尽其潜力时，社会有一种强烈的趋势，即，使自己容易发生危机。在过去，这种趋势往往表现为人口增长，使土地的承载能力达到极限。这种情况在 1000 年的转型之前和十五世纪末都发生过。在这两种情况下，作物歉收和低产造成的实际收入暴跌在摧毁主导机构方面发挥了重要作用。今天，这种边缘化表现在消费信贷市场上。如果急剧变冷的天气降低了作物产量，降低了可支配收入，这将导致债务违约以及税收反叛。如果以过去为鉴，可能会导致经济关闭和政治动荡。</p>

        <!-- <p>3. <strong>Microbes</strong>convey power to harm or immunity from harm in ways that have often determined how power was exercised. This was certainly the case in the European conquest of the New World, as we explored in <em>The Great Reckoning.</em>European settlers, arriving from settled agricultural societies riddled with disease, brought with them relative immunity from childhood infections like measles. The Indians they encountered lived largely in thinly populated foraging bands. They possessed no such immunity and were decimated. Often, the greatest mortality occurred before white people even arrived, as Indians who first encountered Europeans on the coasts traveled inland with infections.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>3. <strong>微生物</strong>传递伤害的力量或免于伤害的方式，往往决定了权力的行使方式。正如我们在《大清算》中所探讨的那样，在欧洲人征服新大陆的过程中，情况肯定是这样的。欧洲定居者从充满疾病的农业社会来到这里，他们带着对麻疹等儿童感染的相对免疫力。他们遇到的印第安人主要生活在人口稀少的觅食队伍中，他们没有这种免疫力，因此被消灭了。通常情况下，最大的死亡率发生在白人到达之前，因为在沿海地区首次遇到欧洲人的印第安人带着病毒回到了内陆。</p>

        <!-- <p>There are also microbiological barriers to the exercise of power. In <em>Blood in the Streets,</em>we discussed the role that potent strains of malaria served in making tropical Africa impervious to invasion by white men for many centuries. Before the discovery of quinine in the mid-nineteenth century, white armies could not survive in malarial regions, however superior their weapons might have been.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在行使权力方面也存在微生物障碍。在《血流成河》一书中，我们讨论了强烈的疟疾菌株在使热带非洲在许多个世纪里不被白人入侵方面所发挥的作用。在十九世纪中期发现奎宁之前，白人军队无法在疟疾地区生存，无论他们的武器有多么优越。</p>

        <!-- <p>The interaction between humans and microbes has also produced important demographic effects that altered the costs and rewards of violence. When fluctuations in mortality are high due to epidemic disease, famine, or other causes, the relative risk of mortality in warfare falls. The declining frequency of eruptions in death rates from the sixteenth century onward helps explain smaller family size and, ultimately, the far lower tolerance of sudden death in war today as compared to the past. This has had the effect of lowering the tolerance for imperialism and raising the costs of projecting power in societies with low birthrates.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>人类和微生物之间的互动也产生了重要的人口效应，改变了暴力的成本和回报。当由于流行病、饥荒或其他原因导致死亡率波动较大时，战争中的相对死亡风险就会下降。从十六世纪开始，死亡率爆发的频率不断下降，这有助于解释较小的家庭规模，并最终解释今天与过去相比，对战争中突然死亡的容忍度要低得多。这产生了降低对帝国主义的容忍度，并提高了在低出生率社会中投射权力的成本的效果。</p>

        <!-- <p>Contemporary societies, comprising small families, tend to find even small numbers of battle deaths intolerable. By contrast, early modern societies were much more tolerant of the mortality costs associated with imperialism. Before this century, most parents gave birth to many children, some of whom were expected to die randomly and suddenly from disease. In an era when early death was commonplace, would-be soldiers and their families faced the dangers of the battlefield with less resistance.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>由小家庭组成的当代社会，往往会发现即使是少量的战死也是无法容忍的。相比之下，早期现代社会对与帝国主义有关的死亡成本的容忍度要高得多。在本世纪之前，大多数父母都生了很多孩子，其中一些孩子预计会随机地突然死于疾病。在一个早期死亡很普遍的时代，未来的士兵和他们的家人在面对战场上的危险时阻力较小。</p>

        <!-- <p>4. <strong>Technology</strong>has played by far the largest role in determining the costs and rewards of projecting power during the modern centuries. The argument of this book presumes it will continue to do so. Technology has several crucial dimensions:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>4. <strong>技术</strong>在决定现代几个世纪中投射权力的成本和回报方面发挥了迄今为止最大的作用。本书的论点是假定它将继续这样做。技术有几个关键的方面：</p>

        <!-- <ol><span class="english"></span> -->
        <ul>

            <!-- <li><em>Balance between offense and defense.</em>The balance between the offense and the defense implied by prevailing weapons technology helps determine the scale of political organization. When offensive capabilities are rising, the ability to project power at a distance predominates, jurisdictions tend to consolidate, and governments form on a larger scale. At other times, like now, defensive capabilities are rising. This makes it more costly to project power outside of core areas. Jurisdictions tend to devolve, and big governments break down into smaller ones.</li><span class="english"></span> -->
            <li><em>进攻和防御之间的平衡。</em>流行的武器技术所隐含的进攻和防御之间的平衡有助于确定政治组织的规模。当进攻能力上升时，远距离投射力量的能力占主导地位，管辖范围趋于巩固，政府形成较大的规模。在其他时候，比如现在，防御能力正在上升。这使得在核心区域之外投射力量的成本更高。管辖权倾向于下放，大政府被分解成小政府。</li>

            <!-- <li><em>Equality and the predominance of the infantry.</em>A key feature determining the degree of equality among citizens is the nature of weapons technology. Weapons that are relatively cheap, can be employed by nonprofessionals, and enhance the military importance of infantry tend to equalize power. When Thomas Jefferson wrote that “all men are created equal,” he was saying something that was much more true than a similar statement would have seemed centuries earlier. A farmer with his hunting rifle was not only as well armed as the typical British soldier with his Brown Bess, he was better armed. The farmer with the rifle could shoot at the soldier from a greater distance, and with greater accuracy than the soldier could return fire. This was a distinctly different circumstance from the Middle Ages, when a farmer with a pitchfork—he could not have afforded more—could scarcely have hoped to stand against a heavily armed knight on horseback. No one was writing in 1276 that “all men are created equal.” At that time, in the most manifestly important sense, men were not equal. A single knight exercised far more brute force than dozens of peasants put together.</li><span class="english"></span> -->
            <li><em>平等和步兵的主导地位。</em>决定公民之间平等程度的一个关键特征是武器技术的性质。相对便宜、可由非专业人员使用的武器，以及提高步兵的军事重要性的武器，往往会使权力平等。当托马斯·杰斐逊写下『人人生而平等』时，他说的东西比几个世纪前的类似声明似乎要真实得多。一个拿着猎枪的农民不仅和拿着布朗贝斯的典型英国士兵一样装备齐全，而且装备得更好。拿着步枪的农民可以从更远的地方向士兵射击，而且比士兵的还击更准确。这与中世纪的情况截然不同，当时一个拿着干草叉的农民 —— 他不可能有更多的钱
                —— 几乎不可能希望对抗一个骑着马的全副武装的骑士。在 1276 年，没有人写过『人人生而平等』。在当时，从最明显的意义上讲，人是不平等的。一个骑士所行使的蛮力远比几十个农民加起来还要多。</li>

            <blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：布朗贝斯（<em>Brown Bess</em>）是一个俗称，正式称呼为『不列颠陆上型步枪』。</blockquote>

            <!-- <li><em>Advantages and disadvantages of scale in violence.</em>Another variable that helps determine whether there are a few large governments or many small ones is the scale of organization required to deploy the prevailing weapons. When there are increasing returns to violence, it is more rewarding to operate governments at a large scale; therefore governments tend to get bigger. When a small group can command effective means of resisting an assault by a large group, which was the case during the Middle Ages, sovereignty tends to fragment. Small, independent authorities exercise many of the functions of government. As we explore in a latter chapter, we believe that the Information Age will bring the dawn of cybersoldiers, who will be heralds of devolution. Cybersoldiers could be deployed not merely by nation-states but by very small organizations, and even by individuals. Wars of the next millennium will include some almost bloodless battles fought with computers.</li><span class="english"></span> -->
            <li><em>暴力规模的利弊。</em>另一个有助于决定是有几个大政府还是有许多小政府的变量是部署流行的武器所需的组织规模。当暴力的回报越来越高时，以大规模运作政府会有更多的回报；因此政府往往会变得更大。当一个小团体可以指挥有效的手段来抵抗一个大团体的攻击时（中世纪就是这样），主权就会趋于分裂。小型的、独立的当局行使政府的许多职能。正如我们在后一章中所探讨的，我们相信信息时代将带来网络士兵的曙光，他们将是权力下放的预言者。网络士兵不仅可以由领土国家部署，还可以由非常小的组织，甚至是个人部署。下一个千年的战争将包括一些用计算机进行的几乎不流血的战斗。</li>

            <!-- <li><p><em>Economies of scale in production.</em>Another important factor that weighs in the balance in determining whether ultimate power is exercised locally or from a distance is the scale of the predominant enterprises in which people gain their livelihoods. When crucial enterprises can function optimally only when they are organized on a large scale in an encompassing trading area, governments that expand to provide such a setting for enterprises under their protection may rake off enough additional wealth to pay the costs of maintaining a large political system. Under such conditions, the entire world economy usually functions more effectively where one supreme world power dominates all others, as the British Empire did in the nineteenth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <li>
                <p><em>生产中的规模经济。</em>在决定最终权力是在当地还是从远方行使的另一个重要因素是人们获得生计的主要企业的规模。当关键的企业只有在大规模的贸易区组织起来才能发挥最佳作用时，那些为其保护下的企业提供这种环境而扩张的政府可能会攫取足够多的额外财富来支付维持一个大型政治体系的费用。在这种情况下，整个世界经济通常在一个最高的世界大国主导所有其他国家的情况下更有效地运作，就像大英帝国在十九世纪那样。
            </li>

            <!-- <p>But sometimes megapolitical variables combine to produce falling economies of scale. If the economic benefits of maintaining a large trading area dwindle, larger governments that previously prospered from exploiting the benefits of encompassing trading areas may begin to break apart—even if the balance of weaponry between offense and defense otherwise remains much as it had been.</p></li><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>但有时『跨政治』变量结合在一起，会产生规模经济的下降。如果维持一个大的贸易区的经济利益减少，以前因利用包围贸易区的利益而繁荣的大国政府可能开始分裂 —— 即使进攻和防御之间的武器平衡在其他方面仍与以前一样。</p>

            <!-- <li><em>Dispersal of technology.</em>Still another factor that contributes to the power equation is the degree of dispersal of key technologies. When weapons or tools of production can be effectively hoarded or monopolized, they tend to centralize power. Even technologies that are essentially defensive in character, like the machine gun, proved to be potent offensive weapons, that contributed to a rising scale of governance during the period when they were not widely dispersed. When the European powers enjoyed a monopoly on machine guns late in the nineteenth century, they were able to use those weapons against peoples at the periphery to dramatically expand colonial empires. Later, in the twentieth century, when machine guns became widely available, especially in the wake of World War II, they were deployed to help destroy the power of empires. Other things being equal, the more widely dispersed key technologies are, the more widely dispersed power will tend to be, and the smaller the optimum scale of government.</li><span class="english"></span> -->
            <li><em>技术的分散。</em>另一个有助于权力方程的因素是关键技术的分散程度。当武器或生产工具能够被有效地囤积或垄断时，它们往往会使权力集中。即使是本质上属于防御性的技术，如机枪，也被证明是强有力的进攻性武器，在它们没有广泛散布的时期，有助于提高治理规模。当欧洲列强在十九世纪末享有对机枪的垄断权时，他们能够使用这些武器来对付边缘地区的人民，从而大幅扩张殖民帝国。后来，在二十世纪，当机枪变得广泛可用时，特别是在第二次世界大战之后，它们被用来帮助摧毁帝国的力量。在其他条件相同的情况下，关键技术分散得越广，权力就越分散，政府的最佳规模也就越小。</li>

        <!-- <h2>THE SPEED OF MEGAPOLITICAL CHANGE</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>『跨政治』变革的速度</h2>

        <!-- <p>While technology is by far the most important factor today, and apparently growing more so, all four major megapolitical factors have played a role in determining the scale at which power could be exercised in the past.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>尽管技术是当今最重要的因素，而且显然越来越重要，但所有四个主要的跨政治因素都在决定过去可以行使权力的规模方面发挥了作用。</p>

        <!-- <p>Together, these factors determine whether the returns to violence continue to rise as violence is employed on a larger scale. This determines the importance of magnitude of firepower versus efficiency in employing resources. It also strongly influences the market distribution of income. The question is, What role will they command in the future? A key to estimating an answer lies in recognizing that these megapolitical variables mutate at dramatically different speeds.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这些因素共同决定了随着暴力的大规模运用，暴力的回报是否会继续上升。这决定了火力规模与资源使用效率的重要性。它也强烈地影响着收入的市场分配。问题是，他们在未来将扮演什么角色？估计答案的一个关键在于认识到这些跨政治变量以极大的不同速度发生变化。</p>

        <!-- <p>Topography has been almost fixed through the whole of recorded history. Except for minor local effects involving the silting of harbors, landfills, or erosion, the topography of the earth is almost the same today as it was when Adam and Eve straggled out of Eden. And it is likely to remain so until another Ice Age recarves the landscapes of continents or some other drastic event disturbs the surface of the earth. At a more profound scale, geological ages seem to shift, perhaps in response to large meteorite strikes, over a period of 10 to 40 million years. Someday, there may again be geological upheavals that will alter significantly the topography of our planet. If that happens, you can safely assume that both the baseball and cricket seasons will be canceled.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在整个有记载的历史中，地形几乎是固定的。除了涉及港口淤塞、垃圾填埋场或侵蚀的轻微局部影响外，今天地球的地形几乎与亚当和夏娃蹒跚走出伊甸园时的地形相同。而且，在另一个冰河时期重新塑造各大洲的地貌或其他一些剧烈的事件扰乱地球表面之前，它很可能会保持不变。在更深远的范围内，地质年代似乎在转变，也许是对大型陨石撞击的反应，时间为 1000 万至 4000 万年。有一天，可能会再次发生地质动荡，大大改变我们星球的地形。如果发生这种情况，你可以有把握地认为，棒球和板球赛季都将被取消。</p>

        <!-- <p>Climate fluctuates much more actively than topography. In the last million years, climatic change has been responsible for most of the known variation in the features of the earth’s surface. During Ice Ages, glaciers gouged new valleys, altered the course of rivers, severed islands from continents or joined them together by lowering the sea level. Fluctuations in climate have played a significant role in history, first in precipitating the Agricultural Revolution after the close of the last Ice Age, and later in destabilizing regimes during periods of colder temperatures and drought.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>气候的波动比地形的波动要活跃得多。在过去的一百万年里，气候变化是造成地球表面特征的大部分已知变化的原因。在冰河时代，冰川开凿了新的山谷，改变了河流的走向，将岛屿从大陆上分割开来，或者通过降低海平面将它们连在一起。气候的波动在历史上发挥了重要作用，首先是在上一个冰河时代结束后催生了农业革命，后来又在温度较低和干旱期间破坏了制度的稳定。</p>

        <!-- <p>Lately, there have been concerns over the possible impact of “global warming.” These concerns cannot be dismissed out of hand. Yet, taking a longer perspective, the more likely risk appears to be a shift toward a colder, not a warmer climate. Study of temperature fluctuations based upon analysis of oxygen isotopes in core samples taken from the ocean floor show that the current period is the second warmest in more than 2 million years.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en22" id="text00008.html#ch02en22">22</a></sup>If temperatures were to turn colder, as they did in the seventeenth century, that might prove megapolitically destabilizing. Current alarms about global warming may in that sense be reassuring. To the extent that they are true, that assures that temperatures will continue to fluctuate within the abnormally warm and relatively benign range experienced for the past three centuries.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>最近，人们对『全球变暖』可能产生的影响表示担忧。这些担忧不能被轻易地否定。然而，从更长远的角度来看，更可能的风险似乎是向更冷而不是更暖的气候转变。根据从海底采集的岩芯样本中的氧同位素分析，对温度波动的研究表明，目前的时期是 200 多万年来第二温暖的时期。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch02-en22" id="text00008.html#ch02en22">22</a></sup>如果温度变冷，像十七世纪那样，这可能证明在政治上是不稳定的。从这个意义上说，目前关于全球变暖的警报可能是令人欣慰的。如果它们是真实的，这就保证了气温将继续在过去三个世纪经历的异常温暖和相对良好的范围内波动。</p>

        <!-- <p>The rate of change in the influence of microbes on the exercise of power is more of a puzzle. Microbes can mutate very rapidly. This is especially true of viruses. The common cold, for example, mutates in an almost kaleidoscopic way. Yet although these mutations proceed apace, their impact in shifting the boundaries where power is exercised have been far less abrupt than technological change. Why? Part of the reason is that the normal balance of nature tends to make it beneficial for microbes to infect but not destroy host populations. Virulent infections that kill their hosts too readily tend to eradicate themselves in the process. The survival of microparasites depends upon their not being too rapidly or uniformly fatal to the hosts they invade.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>微生物对权力行使的影响的变化速度更令人困惑。微生物可以非常迅速地变异。这对病毒来说尤其如此。例如，普通感冒以一种几乎是万花筒般的方式变异。然而，尽管这些变异进行得很快，但它们在改变行使权力的边界方面的影响却远没有技术变革那么突然。为什么呢？部分原因是，自然界的正常平衡倾向于使微生物感染但不破坏宿主种群，这对它们有利。太容易杀死宿主的病毒性感染往往会在这个过程中消灭自己。微量寄生虫的生存取决于它们对它们所入侵的宿主不至于太迅速或一致地致命。</p>

        <!-- <p>That is not to say, of course, that there cannot be deadly eruptions of disease that alter the balance of power. Such episodes have figured prominently in history. The Black Death wiped out large fractions of the population of Eurasia and dealt a crushing blow to the fourteenth-century version of the international economy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当然，这并不是说不可能出现改变力量平衡的致命性疾病爆发。这类事件在历史上占据了重要地位。黑死病消灭了欧亚大陆的大部分人口，并对十四世纪的国际经济造成了毁灭性的打击。</p>

        <!-- <h3>What Might Have Been</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>可能发生的事情</h3>

        <!-- <p>History can be understood in terms of what might have been as well as what was. We know of no reason that microparasites could not have continued to play havoc with human society during the modern period. For example, it is possible that microbiological barriers to the exercise of power, equivalent to malaria but more virulent, could have halted the Western invasion of the periphery in its tracks. The first intrepid Portuguese adventurers who sailed into African waters could have contracted a deadly retrovirus, a more communicable version of AIDS, that would have stopped the opening of the new trade route to Asia before it even began. Columbus, too, and the first waves of settlers in the New World might have encountered diseases that decimated them in the same way that indigenous local populations were affected by measles and other Western childhood diseases. Yet nothing of the kind happened, a coincidence that underlines the intuition that history has a destiny.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>历史可以从可能发生的事情和已经发生的事情来理解。我们知道，在现代时期，微寄生虫没有理由不继续对人类社会造成破坏。例如，有可能行使权力的微生物障碍，相当于疟疾，但毒性更强，可以阻止西方对周边地区的入侵。第一批无畏的葡萄牙冒险家驶入非洲水域时，可能感染了致命的逆转录病毒，即更具传染性的艾滋病版本，这将在新的亚洲贸易路线开始之前就阻止它的开辟。哥伦布和新大陆的第一波定居者也可能遇到疾病，像当地居民受到麻疹和其他西方儿童疾病的影响一样，使他们遭受灭顶之灾。然而，这种情况并没有发生，这种巧合强调了历史是有命运的这一直觉。</p>

        <!-- <p>Microbes did far less to impede the consolidation of power in the modern period than to facilitate it. Western troops and colonists at the periphery often found that the technological advantages that allowed them to project power were underscored by microbiological ones. Westerners were armed with unseen biological weapons, their relative immunity to childhood diseases that frequently devastated native peoples. This gave voyagers from the West a distinct advantage that their antagonists from less densely settled regions lacked. As events unfolded, the disease transfer was almost entirely in one direction—from Europe outward. There was no equivalent transfer of disease in the other direction, from the periphery to the core.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>微生物在现代时期对权力巩固的阻碍远远小于对权力巩固的促进。处于边缘地带的西方军队和殖民者经常发现，使他们能够投射力量的技术优势被微生物的优势所强调。西方人用看不见的生物武器武装起来，他们对经常毁坏原住民的儿童疾病具有相对的免疫力。这使来自西方的航海者具有明显的优势，而他们来自定居密度较低地区的对手则缺乏这种优势。随着事件的发展，疾病的转移几乎完全是单向的 —— 从欧洲向外。在另一个方向，即从周边地区到核心地区，没有相应的疾病转移。</p>

        <!-- <p>As a possible counterexample, some have claimed that Western explorers imported syphilis from the New World to Europe. This is arguable. If true, however, it did not prove to be a significant barrier to the exercise of power. The major impact of syphilis was to shift sexual mores in the West.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>作为一个可能的反例，一些人声称西方探险家将梅毒从新世界传入欧洲。这一点其实是有争议的。然而，如果是真的话，它并没有被证明是行使权力的一个重大障碍。梅毒的主要影响是改变了西方的性道德。</p>

        <!-- <p>From the end of the fifteenth century to the last quarter of the twentieth, the impact of microbes on industrial society was ever more benign. Notwithstanding the personal tragedies and unhappiness caused by outbreaks of tuberculosis, polio, and flu, no new diseases emerged in the modern period that even approached the megapolitical impact of the Antonine plagues or the Black Death. Improving public health, and the advent of vaccinations and antidotes, generally reduced the importance of infectious microbes during the modern period, thereby increasing the relative importance of technology in setting the boundaries where power was exercised.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>从十五世纪末到二十世纪最后 25 年，微生物对工业社会的影响是越来越良性的。尽管肺结核、小儿麻痹症和流感的爆发造成了个人悲剧和不愉快，但在现代时期，没有出现任何新的疾病，甚至接近安东瘟疫或黑死病的跨政治影响。公共卫生的改善，以及疫苗和解毒剂的出现，总体上降低了现代时期传染性微生物的重要性，从而提高了技术在设定权力行使边界方面的相对重要性。</p>

        <!-- <p>The recent emergence of AIDS and alarms over the potential spread of exotic viruses are hints that the role of microbes may not be altogether as megapolitically benign in the future as it has been over the past five hundred years. But when or whether a new plague will infect the world is unknowable. An eruption of microparasites, such as a viral pandemic, rather than drastic changes in climate or topography, would more likely disrupt the megapolitical predominance of technology.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>最近出现的艾滋病和对外来病毒潜在传播的警告暗示，微生物的作用在未来可能不会像过去五百年那样完全是跨政治的良性发展。但何时或是否会有新的瘟疫感染世界是不可知的。微量寄生虫的爆发，如病毒大流行，而不是气候或地形的剧烈变化，将更有可能扰乱技术的跨政治主导地位。</p>

        <!-- <p>We have no way of monitoring or anticipating drastic departures from the nature of life on earth as we have known it.

        <p>五百年前，人类社会组织的第一个阶段性变化开始了。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en1" id="text00009.html#ch03en1">1</a></sup>我们几个地区的祖先不情愿地拿起粗糙的工具、削尖的木桩和临时的锄头，开始工作。当他们播种第一批庄稼时，他们也为世界上的权力奠定了新的基础。农业革命是第一次伟大的经济和社会革命。它从被逐出伊甸园开始，进展非常缓慢，以至于在二十世纪开始时，农业还没有完全取代全球所有合适地区的狩猎和采集。专家们认为，即使是在最早出现农业的近东地区，它也是在『一个漫长的渐进过程』中引入的，『可能花了五千年或更长时间。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en2" id="text00009.html#ch03en2">2</a></sup>这似乎有点夸张。</p>

        <!-- <p>It may seem an exaggeration to describe a process that stretched out over millennia as a “revolution.” Yet that is precisely what the advent of farming was, a slow-motion revolution that transformed human life by altering the logic of violence. Wherever farming took root, violence emerged as a more important feature of social life. Hierarchies adept at manipulating or controlling violence came to dominate society.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>将一个绵延数千年的过程描述为一场『革命』似乎有些夸张。然而，这正是农耕的出现，一场通过改变暴力逻辑而改变人类生活的慢动作革命。凡是农业扎根的地方，暴力就会成为社会生活的一个更重要的特征。善于操纵或控制暴力的等级制度开始主宰社会。</p>

        <!-- <p>Understanding the Agricultural Revolution is a first step toward understanding the Information Revolution. The introduction of tilling and harvesting provides a paradigm example of how an apparently simple shift in the character of work can radically alter the organization of society. Put this past revolution into perspective and you are in a far stronger position to forecast how history may unfold in response to the new logic of violence introduced with microprocessors.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>了解农业革命是理解信息革命的第一步。耕作和收割的引入提供了一个范例，说明工作性质上明显很简单的转变可以从根本上改变社会的组织。将这场过去的革命纳入视野，你就能更有力地预测历史会如何应对微处理器引入的新暴力逻辑。</p>

        <!-- <p>To appreciate the revolutionary character of agriculture, you first need a picture of how the primeval society functioned before farming. We surveyed this in <em>The Great Reckoning</em>and offer a further sketch below. Hunting-and-gathering societies were the only forms of social organization through a long, prehistoric slumber when human life changed little or not at all from generation to generation. Anthropologists claim that humans have been hunters and gatherers for 99 percent of the time since we appeared on earth. Crucial to the long success and ultimate failure of hunting-and-gathering bands is the fact that they had to operate on a very small scale over a very wide area.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>为了理解农业的革命性特征，你首先需要了解原始社会在农耕之前是如何运作的。我们在《大清算》中对此进行了调查，并在下面提供了进一步的简述。狩猎和采集社会是唯一的社会组织形式，经历了漫长的史前沉睡期，当时人类的生活在一代又一代人之间变化不大或者根本没有变化。人类学家声称，自从人类出现在地球上以来，99% 的时间里人类都是狩猎和采集者。狩猎和采集群体长期成功和最终失败的关键是，他们必须在一个非常小的范围内，在一个非常广泛的区域内运作。</p>

        <!-- <p>Foragers could survive only where population densities were light. To see why, think of the problems that larger groups would have posed. For one thing, a thousand hunters parading together across a landscape would have raised such a ruckus as to scare away the game they sought to trap. And even worse, had a small army of hunters occasionally managed to corner a huge herd of game, the food they harvested, including fruits and edible plants found in the wild, could not have remained plentiful for long. A large group of foragers would have laid waste to the countryside through overharvesting like a starving army in the Thirty Years War. Therefore, to minimize overkill, hunting bands had to be small. As Stephen Boyden writes in <em>Western Civilization in Biological Perspective,</em>“Most commonly, hunter-gatherer groups number between twenty-five and fifty individuals.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en3" id="text00009.html#ch03en3">3</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>觅食者只有在人口密度低的地方才能生存。要想知道为什么，请想一想较大的群体会带来的问题。首先，一千名猎人一起在狩猎区内巡游，会引起很大的骚动，从而吓跑他们想要捕猎的动物。更糟糕的是，如果一小群猎人偶尔能抓到一大群猎物，他们收获的食物，包括在野外发现的水果和可食用植物，不可能长期保持丰富。一大群觅食者会像三十年战争中的饥饿军队一样，通过过度采摘浪费农村。因此，为了尽量减少过度捕杀，狩猎队必须是小规模的。正如斯蒂芬·博伊登在《生物学视角下的西方文明》中写道，『最常见的是，狩猎采集者群体的人数在
            25 至 50 人之间。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en3" id="text00009.html#ch03en3">3</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>To live on ten thousand acres in a temperate climate today is a luxury allowed only to the very rich. A family of hunter-gatherers could scarcely have survived on less. They generally required thousands of acres per person, even in areas that were most fertile for foraging. This suggests why the growth of human populations during periods particularly favorable to foraging may have created the basis for population crises. Because so much land was required to support a single person, the population densities of hunting-and-gathering societies had to be incredibly sparse. Before farming, humans were about as densely settled as bears.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>今天，在温带气候下生活在一万英亩的土地上是一种奢侈，只有非常富有的人才能享受到。一个狩猎采集者的家庭几乎不可能靠更少的土地生存。他们通常每人需要数千英亩的土地，即使是在最肥沃的觅食地区。这说明为什么在特别有利于觅食的时期，人类人口的增长可能为人口危机的发生奠定了基础。由于养活一个人需要这么多的土地，狩猎和采集社会的人口密度必须非常稀疏。在耕种之前，人类的居住密度就像熊一样稀疏。</p>

        <!-- <p>With minor differences, the human diet resembled that of bears. Foraging societies depended upon food gathered from the open countryside or from nearby bodies of water. Although some gatherers were fishers, most were hunters who depended for a third to a fifth of their food upon protein from large mammals. Other than a few simple tools and objects carried around with them, hunter-gatherers had almost no technology at their disposal. They usually had no way to effectively store quantities of meat or other foods for later use. Most food had to be consumed soon after it was gathered or left to spoil. That is not say, of course, that some hunter-gatherers did not eat spoiled food. Eskimos, as Boyden reports, “are said to have a particular liking for decomposed food.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en4" id="text00009.html#ch03en4">4</a></sup>He repeats the observations of experts that Eskimos “ ‘bury fish heads and allow them to decay until the bones become of the same consistency as the flesh. They then knead the reeking mass into a paste and eat it’; they also enjoy the ‘fat maggoty larvae of the caribou fly served raw … deer droppings, munched like berries… and marrow more than a year old, swarming with maggots.’ ”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en5" id="text00009.html#ch03en5">5</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>除了微小的差异，人类的饮食与熊相似。觅食社会依赖于从开放的乡村或附近的水体中收集的食物。虽然有些采集者是渔民，但大多数人是猎人，他们的食物中有三分之一到五分之一依靠大型哺乳动物的蛋白质。除了一些简单的工具和随身携带的物品外，狩猎采集者几乎没有任何技术可供他们使用。他们通常没有办法有效地储存大量的肉类或其他食物供以后使用。大多数食物在采集后不久就必须吃掉，或者任其变质。当然，这并不是说有些狩猎·采集者不吃变质的食物。正如博伊登所报告的那样，据说爱斯基摩人特别喜欢腐烂的食物。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en4" id="text00009.html#ch03en4">4</a></sup>他重复了专家的观察，『爱斯基摩人埋葬鱼头，让它们腐烂，直到骨头变得和鱼肉一样稠。然后他们把散发着恶臭的一团东西揉成糊状吃掉；他们还喜欢『生吃驯鹿苍蝇的肥大蛆虫幼虫……
            鹿的粪便，像浆果一样咀嚼…… 还有一年以上的骨髓，上面涌满了蛆虫。』 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en5" id="text00009.html#ch03en5">5</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Other than such delicacies, foragers developed little surplus food. As anthropologist Gregg notes, “mobile populations generally do not store foodstuffs against seasonal or unexpected lows in resource availability.” Consequently, foragers had little to steal. A division of labor that included specialization to employ violence was insupportable in settings where surplus food could not be stored. The logic of the hunt also dictated that violence among hunting-and-foraging bands could never rise above a small scale because the groups themselves had to remain tiny.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>除了这些美味之外，觅食者几乎没有开发什么剩余的食物。正如人类学家格雷格所指出的，『流动人口一般不储存食品，以应对资源供应的季节性或意外低谷』。因此，觅食者没有什么可偷的。在无法储存剩余食物的情况下，专门从事暴力活动是不可行的。狩猎的逻辑也决定了狩猎和觅食群体之间的暴力永远不可能超过小规模，因为这些群体本身必须保持小规模。</p>

        <!-- <p>The small scale of foraging bands was advantageous in another way. Members of such small groups would have known one another intimately, a factor that made them more effective in working together. Decision-making becomes more difficult as numbers rise, because incentive traps proliferate. You need only think how hard it is to get a dozen people organized to go out to dinner. Imagine how hopeless would have been the task of organizing hundreds or thousands of persons to traipse around on a moveable feast. Lacking any sustained and separate political organization or bureaucracy required by specialization for war, hunting-and-gathering bands had to depend on persuasion and consensus—principles that work best among small groups with relatively easygoing attitudes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>觅食队的小规模在另一个方面是有利的。这种小群体的成员会彼此熟悉，这一因素使他们在一起工作时更加有效。随着数量的增加，决策会变得更加困难，因为激励性的陷阱会激增。你只需要想一想，让十几个人组织起来出去吃饭是多么困难。想象一下，组织成百上千的人在一个并不固定的盛宴上走来走去会是多么无望的任务。由于缺乏战争专业化所需的持续和独立的政治组织或官僚机构，狩猎和采集队不得不依靠说服和共识原则，而这些原则在态度相对随和的小团体中最有效。</p>

        <!-- <p>Whether hunting-and-gathering bands were easygoing is open to debate. Sir Henry Maine refers to “the universal belligerency of primitive man.” In his words, “It is not peace which is natural and primitive but war.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en6" id="text00009.html#ch03en6">6</a></sup>His view has been underlined by the work of evolutionary biologists. R. Paul Shaw and Yuwa Wong comment: “There are strong indications that many of the injuries apparent in remains of Australopithecus, Homo erectus, and Homo sapiens of the European fourth and pre-fourth glacial periods resulted from combat.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en7" id="text00009.html#ch03en7">7</a></sup>But others doubt this. Experts like Stephen Boyden argue that primitive groups were usually not warlike or prone to violence. Social conventions developed to reduce internal tensions and facilitate the sharing of the hunt. Especially in areas where humans preyed on larger game, which was difficult for a single hunter to fell, religious and social doctrines emerged to facilitate the redistribution of any game that was taken with the whole group. The first priority of sharing of caloric resources was with other hunters. Necessity, rather than sentiment, was the spur. The first claim on the resources was exercised by the most economically competent and militarily strong, not by the sick and the weak. Undoubtedly, a major influence informing this priority was the fact that hunters in the prime of life were also militarily the most potent members of the small band. By assuring them a first claim on the hunt, the group minimized potentially lethal internal squabbling.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>狩猎和采集队是否随和，还有待商榷。亨利·梅恩爵士提到了『原始人的普遍好战性』。用他的话说，『自然和原始的不是和平，而是战争。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en6" id="text00009.html#ch03en6">6</a></sup>『他的观点已被进化生物学家的工作所强调。』R. Paul Shaw 和 Yuwa Wong 评论说。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en7" id="text00009.html#ch03en7">7</a></sup>但其他人对此表示怀疑。像斯蒂芬·博伊登这样的专家认为，原始群体通常不喜欢战争或容易发生暴力。社会惯例的发展是为了减少内部的紧张关系，促进分享猎物。特别是在人类捕食较大的猎物的地区，单个猎人很难倒下，于是出现了宗教和社会教义，以方便重新分配任何与整个群体一起捕获的猎物。分享热量资源的首要任务是与其他猎手分享。必要性，而不是情感，是一种鞭策。对资源的第一要求是由经济上最有能力和军事上最强大的人提出的，而不是由病人和弱者提出。毋庸置疑，影响这种优先权的一个主要因素是，正值壮年的猎人在军事上也是小队中最有实力的成员。通过保证他们在狩猎中的优先权，该群体最大限度地减少了潜在的致命的内部争吵。</p>

        <!-- <p>So long as population densities remained low, the foragers’ gods were not militant gods but embodiments of natural forces or the animals they hunted. The scantiness of capital and open frontiers made war in most cases unnecessary. There were few neighbors outside one’s own small family or clan to pose threats. Because foragers tended to roam in search of food, personal possessions beyond a bare minimum became an encumbrance. Those with few possessions necessarily experienced little property crime. When conflicts arose, the contending parties were often content to walk away because they had little invested in any given locale. Escape was an easy solution to personal feuds or exorbitant demands of other kinds. This does not mean that early humans were peaceful. They may have been violent and unpleasant to a degree we can scarcely imagine. But if they employed violence, it was mostly for personal reasons or, what may be worse, for sport.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>只要人口密度保持在低水平，觅食者的神就不是好战的神，而是自然力量或他们猎杀的动物的化身。资本的匮乏和边境的开放使得战争在大多数情况下根本不必要。除了自己的小家庭或部族之外，很少有邻居会构成威胁。由于觅食者倾向于漫无目的地寻找食物，超出最低限度的个人财产成为一种负担。那些财产不多的人必然会经历很少的财产犯罪。当冲突发生时，争执的各方往往满足于走开，因为他们在任何特定的地方都没有什么投资。逃跑是解决个人恩怨或其他类型的过高要求的一个简单办法。这并不意味着早期人类是和平的。他们的暴力和不愉快可能达到了我们几乎无法想象的程度。但是，如果他们使用暴力，那多半是出于个人原因，或者更糟糕的是，出于运动。</p>

        <!-- <p>The livelihoods of hunter-gatherers depended upon their functioning in small bands that allowed little or no scope for a division of labor other than along gender lines. They had no organized government, usually no permanent settlements, and no possibility for accumulating wealth. Even such basic building blocks of civilization as a written language were unknown in the primeval economy. Without a written language there could be no formal records and no history.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <h2><em>Overkill</em></h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>过度杀戮</h2>

        <!-- <p>The dynamic of foraging created very different incentives to work than those to which we have become accustomed since the advent of farming. The capital requirements for life as a forager were minimal. A few primitive tools and weapons sufficed. There was no outlet for investment, not even private property in land, except occasionally in quarries where flint or soapstone was mined.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en8" id="text00009.html#ch03en8">8</a></sup>As anthropologist Susan Ailing Gregg wrote in <em>Foragers and Farmers,</em>“Ownership of and access to resources” was “held in common by the group.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en9" id="text00009.html#ch03en9">9</a></sup>With rare exceptions, such as fishers living on the shores of lakes, foragers usually had no fixed place of abode. Having no permanent homes, they had little need to work hard to acquire property or maintain it. They had no mortgage or taxes to pay, no furniture to buy. Their few consumer goods were animal skins, and personal adornments made by members of the group themselves. There was little incentive to acquire or accumulate anything that might have passed for money because there was little to buy. Under such conditions, savings for the foragers could have been no more than a rudimentary concept.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>觅食的动力创造了非常不同的工作动机，与我们在农业出现后所习惯的动机不同。觅食者生活所需的资本是最小的。一些原始的工具和武器就够了。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en8" id="text00009.html#ch03en8">8</a></sup>正如人类学家 Susan Ailing Gregg 在《觅食者和农民》中写道，『资源的所有权和使用权是由群体共同拥有的。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en9" id="text00009.html#ch03en9">9</a></sup>除了极少数的例外，如居住在湖边的渔民，觅食者通常没有固定的居住地。由于没有固定的住所，他们几乎不需要努力工作来获得财产或维护财产。他们没有抵押贷款或纳税，没有家具需要购买。他们为数不多的消费品是动物皮毛，以及由群体成员自己制作的个人装饰品。因为没有什么可买的东西，所以没有什么动力去获取或积累任何可能被当作金钱的东西。在这样的条件下，牧民的储蓄可能不过是一个基本的概念。</p>

        <!-- <p>With no reason to earn and almost no division of labor, the concept of hard work as a virtue must have been foreign to hunting-and-gathering groups. Except during periods of unusual hardship, when protracted effort was required to find something to eat, little work was done because little was needed. There was literally nothing to be gained by working beyond the bare minimum required for survival. For the members of the typical hunting-and-gathering band, that meant working only about eight to fifteen hours a week.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en10" id="text00009.html#ch03en10">10</a></sup>Because a hunter’s labor did not augment the food supply but could only reduce it, one who heroically labored overtime to kill more animals or pick more fruit than could be eaten before it spoiled contributed nothing to prosperity. To the contrary, overkill reduced the prospects of finding food in the future, and thus had a detrimental impact on the well-being of the group. That is why some foragers, such as Eskimos, punished or ostracized members of the band who engaged in overkill.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>由于没有赚钱的理由，也几乎没有劳动分工，勤奋工作作为一种美德的概念对狩猎和采集群体来说肯定是陌生的。除了在不寻常的困难时期，当需要长期努力寻找食物时，很少有人工作，因为没有什么需要。除了生存所需的最低限度的工作外，实际上没有什么可以得到的。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en10" id="text00009.html#ch03en10">10</a></sup>因为猎人的劳动并不能增加食物供应，而只能减少它，一个人如果英勇地加班杀更多的动物或摘更多的水果，在它变质之前就能吃到，对繁荣没有任何贡献。相反，过度杀戮会减少未来寻找食物的前景，从而对群体的福祉产生不利影响。这就是为什么一些觅食者，如爱斯基摩人，会惩罚或排斥那些从事过度杀戮的成员。</p>

        <!-- <p>The example of the Eskimos punishing overkill is particularly telling, because they, far more than others, might well have been able to store meat by freezing it. Further, it would have been feasible to provide at least some storage for oils rendered from large marine animals. The fact that foragers generally chose not to do so reflects their far more passive interactions with nature. It may also indicate the degree to which cognition and mental processes are biased by culture. Constraints on learning and behavior in complex environments make adoption of some strategies far more difficult than would otherwise appear. As R. Paul Shaw and Yuwa Wong have written, “Because niches differ in many respects, so, too, do biases in learning.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en11" id="text00009.html#ch03en11">11</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>爱斯基摩人惩罚过度杀戮的例子特别有说服力，因为他们远比其他人更有能力通过冷冻来储存肉类。此外，为大型海洋动物榨出的油提供至少一些存储空间也是可行的。觅食者通常选择不这样做，这反映了他们与自然的互动更为被动。这也可能表明认知和心理过程受文化影响的程度。在复杂的环境中，对学习和行为的限制使一些策略的采用远比看起来更困难。正如 R.Paul Shaw 和 Yuwa Wong 所写的那样，『由于小天地在许多方面存在差异，学习中的偏见也是如此。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en11" id="text00009.html#ch03en11">11</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Seen in this perspective, the advent of agriculture entailed more than a change in diet; it also launched a great revolution in the organization of economic life and culture as well as a transformation of the logic of violence. Farming created large-scale capital assets in land and sometimes in irrigation systems. The crops and domesticated animals farmers raised were valuable assets. They could be stored, hoarded, and stolen. Because crops had to be tended over the entire growing season, from planting through harvest, migration away from threats became less attractive, especially in arid regions where opportunities to grow crops were confined to the small areas of the land with dependable water supplies. As escape became more difficult, opportunities for organized shakedowns and plunder increased. Farmers were subject to raids at harvesttime, which gradually raised the scale of warfare.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>从这个角度来看，农业的出现所带来的不仅仅是饮食的改变；它还在经济生活和文化的组织方面发起了一场巨大的革命，并对暴力的逻辑进行了改造。农业创造了大规模的土地资本资产，有时也创造了灌溉系统。农民饲养的农作物和驯养的动物是有价值的资产。它们可以被储存、囤积和盗窃。由于农作物从种植到收获的整个生长季节都需要照料，因此，远离威胁的迁移变得不那么有吸引力，特别是在干旱地区，种植农作物的机会被限制在有可靠水源的小块土地上。随着逃跑变得更加困难，有组织的抢劫和掠夺的机会也增加了。农民们在收割时受到袭击，这逐渐提高了战争的规模。</p>

        <!-- <p>This tended to increase the size of societies because contests of violence more often than not were won by the larger group. As competition over land and control of its output became more intense, societies became more stationary. A division of labor became more apparent. Employment and slavery arose for the first time. Farmers and herders specialized in producing food. Potters produced containers in which food was stored. Priests prayed for rain and bountiful harvests. Specialists in violence, the forefathers of government, increasingly devoted themselves to plunder and protection from plunder. Along with the priests, they became the first wealthy persons in history.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这往往会扩大社会的规模，因为暴力的竞争往往是由较大的群体获胜。由于对土地的竞争和对土地产出的控制变得更加激烈，社会变得更加固定。劳动分工变得更加明显。就业和奴隶制第一次出现了。农民和牧民专门生产食物。陶工生产储存食物的容器。祭司们祈求雨水和丰收。暴力专家，政府的前身，在越来越多地致力于掠夺和保护自己免受掠夺。与祭司一起，他们成为历史上第一批富人。</p>

        <!-- <p>In the early stages of agricultural societies, these warriors came to control a portion of the annual crop as a price of protection. In places where threats were minimal, yeoman farmers were sometimes able to retain a relatively large degree of autonomy. But as population densities rose, and competition over food intensified, especially in regions around deserts where productive land was at a premium, the warrior group could take a large fraction of total output. These warriors founded the first states with the proceeds of this rake-off, which reached as high as 25 percent of the grain crop and one-half the increase in herds of domesticated animals. Farming, therefore, dramatically increased the importance of coercion. The surge in resources capable of being plundered led to a large surge in plunder.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在农业社会的早期阶段，这些战士开始控制一部分年度作物，作为保护的代价。在威胁最小的地方，贵族农民有时能够保留相对较大的自主权。但是，随着人口密度的增加，对食物的竞争加剧，特别是在沙漠周围的地区，生产性土地的价格很高，战士集团可以拿走总产量的很大一部分。这些战士用这种抽成的收益建立了第一批国家，其收益高达粮食作物的 25% 和驯养动物群增长量的二分之一。因此，农业极大地提高了胁迫的重要性。能够被掠夺的资源的激增导致了掠夺的大量增加。</p>

        <!-- <p>It took millennia for the full logic of the Agricultural Revolution to play itself out. For a long while, sparse populations of farmers in temperate regions may have lived much as their foraging forebears had done. Where land and rainfall were ample, farmers harvested crops on a small scale without much violent interference. But as populations rose over a period of several thousand years, farmers even in thinly settled regions became subject to erratic plunder that sometimes must have left them with insufficient seed to replant the next year’s crop. Competitive plundering, or anarchy, was a possibility at one extreme, as well as unprotected communities living without any specialized organization to monopolize violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>农业革命的全部逻辑花了几千年的时间才得以体现。在很长一段时间里，温带地区稀疏的农民群体可能会像他们的觅食祖先那样生活。在土地和降雨充足的地方，农民们在没有太多暴力干扰的情况下小规模地收割农作物。但随着几千年来人口的增加，即使是在人口稀少的地区，农民也会受到不稳定的掠夺，有时他们肯定没有足够的种子来重新种植第二年的作物。竞争性掠夺或无政府状态是一个极端，也是一个没有任何专门组织来垄断暴力的无保护的社区。</p>

        <!-- <p>As time passed, the logic of violence inherent in agriculture imposed itself over an ever-wider terrain. The regions where farming and herding could continue without the predations of government receded to a few truly remote areas. The Kafir regions of Afghanistan, to cite an extreme example, resisted the imposition of government until the last decade of the nineteenth century. But in so doing, they were transformed centuries earlier into a quite militant society, organized along kinship lines. Such arrangements were not capable of mustering force on a large scale. Until the British brought modern weapons to the region, the Kafirs remained independent in their remote Bashgal and Waigal valleys because their redoubts were protected by features of topography, high mountains, and deserts that stood between them and conquerors from the outside.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en12" id="text00009.html#ch03en12">12</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>随着时间的推移，农业中固有的暴力逻辑在越来越广的范围内实施。可以在没有政府掠夺的情况下继续耕种和放牧的地区退缩到少数真正的偏远地区。举个极端的例子，阿富汗的 Kafir 地区一直抵制政府的强权，直到十九世纪的最后十年。但在这样做的过程中，他们在几个世纪前就被改造成了一个相当好战的社会，按照亲属关系组织起来。这样的安排不能够大规模地集结力量。在英国人将现代武器带到该地区之前，卡菲尔人在他们偏远的巴什加尔和瓦加尔山谷中保持独立，因为他们的堡垒受到地形特征、高山和沙漠的保护，这些都是他们与外部征服者之间的障碍。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en12" id="text00009.html#ch03en12">12</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Over time, the basic logic of the Agricultural Revolution impressed itself on the societies where farming took hold. Farming sharply raised the scale at which human communities could form. Beginning about ten thousand years ago, cities began to emerge. Although tiny by today's standards, they were the centers of the first “civilizations,” a word derived from <em>civitas,</em>which means “citizenship” or “inhabitants of a city” in Latin. Because farming created assets to plunder and to protect, it also created a requirement for inventory accounting. You cannot tax unless you can compile records and issue receipts. The symbols employed in the accountant's ledger became the rudiments of written language, an innovation that had never existed among hunters and gatherers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>随着时间的推移，农业革命的基本逻辑在农业发展的社会中留下了深刻印象。耕作急剧提高了人类社区的规模。从大约一万年前开始，城市开始出现了。尽管以今天的标准来看，城市很小，但它们是第一批『文明』的中心，这个词来自 <em>civitas</em>，在拉丁语中是『公民权』或『城市居民』。由于农业创造了可供掠夺和保护的资产，它也创造了对库存会计的要求。除非你能汇编记录和开具收据，否则你无法征税。会计师账簿中使用的符号成为书面语言的雏形，这种创新在狩猎者和采集者中从未出现过。</p>

        <!-- <p>Farming also extended the horizon over which humans had to solve problems. Hunting bands lived within an immediate time horizon. They seldom undertook projects that lasted more than a few days. But planting and harvesting a crop took months. Pursuing projects of a longer time frame led farmers to train their attentions on the stars. Detailed astronomical observations were a precondition for drawing up almanacs and calendars to serve as guides on when to best plant and reap. With the advent of farming, human horizons expanded.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>农业还扩大了人类解决问题的范围。狩猎队生活在一个即时的时间范围内。他们很少开展持续时间超过几天的项目。但种植和收获庄稼需要几个月的时间。追求更长的时间框架的项目使农民把注意力集中在星星上。详细的天文观测是制定历法和日历的前提条件，以作为何时种植和收割的最佳指南。随着农业的出现，人类的视野也随之扩大。</p>

        <!-- <h2>PROPERTY</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>财产</h2>

        <!-- <p>The move to a settled agricultural society resulted in the emergence of private property. Obviously, no one would be content to toil through the whole growing season to produce a crop just to see someone else wander along and harvest what he produced. The idea of property emerged as an inevitable consequence of farming. But the clarity of private property as a concept was attenuated by the logic of violence that also accompanied the introduction of farming. The emergence of property was confused by the fact that the megapolitical power of individuals was no longer as equal as it had been in foraging societies, where every healthy adult male was a hunter, as well armed as anyone else. Farming gave rise to specialization in violence. Precisely because it created something to steal, farming made investments in better weaponry profitable. The result was theft, much of it highly organized.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>向定居农业社会的转变导致了私有财产的出现。显然，没有人会满足于通过整个生长季节的辛勤劳动来生产作物，而只是看到别人徘徊着收获他生产的东西。财产的概念是作为农业的一个必然结果出现的。但是，作为一个概念，私有财产的明确性被伴随着农耕的引入而出现的暴力逻辑所削弱。财产的出现被这样一个事实所迷惑，即个人的跨政治权力不再像在觅食社会中那样平等，在那里每个健康的成年男性都是猎人，和其他人一样武装齐全。耕作引起了暴力的专业化。正是因为它创造了可以偷窃的东西，耕作使得投资更好的武器装备变得有利可图。其结果是盗窃，其中大部分是高度有组织的盗窃。</p>

        <!-- <p>The powerful were now able to organize a new form of predation: a local monopoly of violence, or government. This sharply differentiated society, creating quite different circumstances for those who benefited from the plunder, and the mass of poor who tilled the fields. The few who controlled military power could now become rich, along with others who found favor with them. The god-kings and their allies, the various lesser, local potentates who ruled the first Near Eastern states, enjoyed much more nearly modern forms of property than the great mass who toiled beneath them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>有权势的人现在能够组织一种新的掠夺形式：当地的暴力垄断，或者说政府。这使社会急剧分化，为那些从掠夺中获益的人和耕种田地的广大穷人创造了相当不同的环境。少数控制军事力量的人现在可以变得富有，还有那些得到他们青睐的人。神王和他们的盟友，即统治最早的近东国家的各种较小的地方势力，比在他们下面劳作的广大民众享有更接近现代形式的财产。</p>

        <!-- <p>Of course, it is anachronistic to think of a distinction between private and public wealth in the early agricultural societies. The ruling god-king had the full resources of the state at his disposal in a way that could hardly be distinguished from ownership of a sprawling estate. Much as in the feudal period of European history, all property was subject to the overlordship of higher potentates. Those down the chain of hierarchy found their property subject to attenuation at the whim of the ruler.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>当然，在早期的农业社会中，要想区分私人和公共财富是不合时宜的。执政的神王拥有国家的全部资源供其支配，其方式与庞大的庄园所有权几乎没有什么区别。与欧洲历史上的封建时期一样，所有的财产都受制于更高的权贵。那些在等级制度下的人发现他们的财产会因统治者的随意性而减少。</p>

        <!-- <p>Yet to say that the potentate was not restrained by law does not mean that he could afford to seize anything he pleased. Costs and rewards impinged upon the freedom of the pharaoh as much as they do today upon the prime minister of Canada. And the pharaoh was much more constrained than contemporary leaders by the difficulties of transport and communication. Simply hauling loot from one spot to the next, especially when loot was measured mainly in the form of agricultural produce, involved a lot of loss from spoilage and theft. The proliferation of officials to check on one another reduced the loss due to pilfering but increased the total overhead costs the pharaoh had to bear. Decentralized authority, which optimized output under some circumstances, also gave rise to stronger local powers who sometimes blossomed into full-fledged challengers for dynastic control. Even Oriental despots were by no means free to do as they pleased. They had no choice but to recognize the balance of raw power as they found it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>然而，说君主不受法律约束并不意味着他可以随心所欲地攫取任何东西。成本和报酬对法老的自由造成了影响，就像今天对加拿大总理的影响一样。而且法老比当代领导人更受交通和通讯困难的限制。仅仅是将战利品从一个地方拖到另一个地方，特别是当战利品主要是以农产品的形式衡量时，就会因变质和偷窃而造成大量损失。官员们互相检查，减少了偷窃造成的损失，但增加了法老不得不承担的总管理费用。分散的权力，在某些情况下优化了产出，也催生了更强大的地方势力，这些势力有时会发展成对王朝控制的全面挑战者。即使是东方的专制者也绝非可以随心所欲地行事。他们别无选择，在发现其他初始权力的时候，只能承认那些彼此力量之间的平衡。</p>

        <!-- <p>Although everyone, including the rich, was subject to arbitrary expropriation, some were able to accumulate property of their own. Then as now, the state devoted much of its income to public works. Projects such as irrigation systems, religious monuments, and crypts for the kings provided opportunities for architects and artisans to earn income. Some well-situated individuals were able to accumulate considerable private property. In fact, a large portion of the surviving cuneiform tablets from Sumer, an early Mesopotamian civilization, record various acts of trade, most of which involve the transfer of property titles.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>尽管每个人，包括富人，都会被任意征用，但有些人还是能够积累自己的财产。当时和现在一样，国家将大部分收入用于公共工程。灌溉系统、宗教纪念碑和国王的墓穴等项目为建筑师和工匠提供了赚取收入的机会。一些有条件的人能够积累大量的私人财产。事实上，美索不达米亚早期文明苏美尔现存的楔形文字片中，有很大一部分记录了各种贸易行为，其中大部分涉及财产所有权的转让。</p>

        <!-- <p>There was private property in the early agricultural societies, but seldom at the bottom of the social pyramid. The overwhelming majority of the population were peasants who were too poor to accumulate much wealth. In fact, with a few exceptions, most peasants, up until modern times, were so poor that they stood in constant danger of perishing from starvation any time that a drought or a flood or an infestation reduced crop yields. Hence the peasants were obliged to organize their affairs in a way that minimized the downside risks in bad years. Across the broad and impoverished stratum of society, a more primitive organization of property obtained. It increased the chance of survival at the expense of foreclosing the greater part of the opportunity to accumulate capital and rise in the economic system.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>早期农业社会有私有财产，但在社会金字塔的底层很少有。绝大多数人口是农民，他们太穷了，无法积累很多财富。事实上，除了少数例外，直到现代，大多数农民都是如此贫穷，以至于在干旱、洪水或虫害降低作物产量时，他们随时都有被饿死的危险。因此，农民不得不以一种方式来组织他们的事务，以尽量减少坏年景下的风险。在整个社会的广泛而贫困的阶层中，获得了一种更原始的财产组织。它增加了生存的机会，但却剥夺了大部分积累资本和在经济体系中崛起的机会。</p>

        <!-- <h3>Peasant Insurance</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>小农保险</h3>

        <!-- <p>The form that this bargain took was the adoption of what anthropologists and social historians describe as the “closed village.” Almost every peasant society in premodern times had, as its main form of economic organization, the “closed village.” Unlike more modern forms of economic organization, in which individuals tend to deal with many buyers and sellers in an open market, the households of the closed village joined together to operate like an informal corporation, or a large family, not in an open marketplace but in a closed system where all the economic transactions of the village tended to be struck with a single monopolist—the local landlord, or his agents among the village chiefs. The village as a whole would contract with the landlord, usually for payment in kind, for a high proportion of the crop, rather than a fixed rent. The proportional rent meant that the landlord absorbed part of the downside risk of a bad harvest. Of course, the landlord also took the greater part of the potential profit. Landlords also typically provided seed.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这种讨价还价的形式采用的是人类学家和社会历史学家所描述的那种『封闭村庄』。在前现代时期，几乎每一个农民社会都以『封闭村庄』作为其主要的经济组织形式。与更现代的经济组织形式不同的是，个人倾向于在一个开放的市场上与许多买家和卖家打交道，而封闭村庄中的家庭联合起来，像一个非正式的公司或一个大家庭一样运作，不是在一个开放的市场上，而是在一个封闭系统中，村庄的所有经济交易倾向于与一个单一的垄断者 —— 当地的地主，或他在村长中的代理人达成。整个村庄会与地主签订合同，通常是以实物形式支付高比例的庄稼，而不是固定的租金。按比例的租金意味着地主吸收了歉收的部分负面风险。当然，地主也拿走了大部分的潜在利润。地主通常还提供种子。</p>

        <!-- <p>This convention also minimized the danger of starvation. It required that the landlord, rather than the peasant, save a disproportionate share of his part of the harvest. Because agricultural yields were appallingly low in many areas in the past, as many as two seeds had to be planted for every three harvested. Under such conditions, a bad harvest would mean mass starvation. The peasants rationally preferred an arrangement which would require the landlord to invest in their survival. At the cost of buying at monopolized prices, selling cheaply, and providing the landlord with in-kind labor, the peasants increased their chances of survival. A similar impulse led the typical peasant in a closed village economy to forgo the security of freehold property ownership. By putting themselves at the mercy of the village head-man, a peasant family improved its chances of benefiting from the regular redistribution of fields. Not infrequently, the headman would take the best fields for himself and his favorites. But that was a risk that peasants had to tolerate in order to enjoy the survival insurance that confused village ownership of fields provided. At times when crop yields were miserably low, a difference in growing conditions of fields a hundred yards apart could make the difference between starvation and survival. Peasants frequently opted for the arrangement that lowered the downside risk, even at the cost of forgoing any hope of increased prosperity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这一惯例也使饥饿的危险降到最低。它要求地主，而不是农民，从他的那部分收获中节省出不成比例的份额。由于过去许多地区的农业产量低得惊人，每收割三粒种子就必须种下两粒。在这种情况下，收成不好就意味着大规模的饥饿。农民理性地倾向于一种要求地主为他们的生存投资的安排。以垄断价格购买、廉价销售和向地主提供实物劳动为代价，农民增加了他们的生存机会。类似的冲动使封闭的乡村经济中的典型农民放弃了自由财产所有权的保障。通过将自己置于村长的摆布之下，一个农民家庭提高了从定期重新分配田地中获益的机会。村长经常会把最好的田地留给自己和他的宠儿。但这是农民必须忍受的风险，以便享受村里混乱的田地所有权提供的生存保险。在作物产量低得可怜的时候，相隔一百码的田地的生长条件不同，就会造成饥饿和生存之间的差异。农民们经常选择降低风险的安排，甚至不惜放弃任何增加繁荣的希望。</p>

        <!-- <p>In general, risk-averse behavior has been common among all groups that operated along the margins of survival. The sheer challenge of survival in premodern societies always constrained the behavior of the poor. An interesting feature of this risk aversion, explored in <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>is that it reduced the range of peaceful economic behavior that individuals were socially permitted to adopt. Taboos and social constraints limited experimentation and innovative behavior, even at the obvious cost of forgoing potentially advantageous improvements in settled ways of doing things.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en13" id="text00009.html#ch03en13">13</a></sup>This
was a rational reflection of the fact that experimentation increases the variability of results. Greater variability means not only potentially greater gains but—more ominously for those at the very margin of survival—potentially ruinous losses.
A great part of the cultural energy of poor farming societies has always been devoted to suppressing experimentation. This repression, in effect, was their substitute for insurance policies. If they had insurance, or sufficient savings to
self-insure their experiments, such strong social taboos would not be needed to help ensure survival.</p>
<span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>一般来说，规避风险的行为在所有在生存边缘活动的群体中都很常见。在前现代社会中，纯粹的生存挑战总是制约着穷人的行为。在《大清算》中探讨的这种风险规避的一个有趣特征是，它减少了社会允许个人采取的和平经济行为的范围。禁忌和社会约束限制了实验和创新行为，甚至以放弃对已确定的做事方式的潜在有利改进为明显代价。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en13" id="text00009.html#ch03en13">13</a></sup>这是对实验增加结果的可变性这一事实的理性反映。更大的可变性不仅意味着潜在的更大的收益，而且
            —— 对于那些处于生存边缘的人来说，更不祥的是 —— 潜在的毁灭性损失。贫穷的农业社会的很大一部分文化能量一直致力于压制尝试。这种压制，实际上是他们对一种保险政策。如果他们有保险，或者有足够的储蓄来为他们的尝试进行自我保险，就不需要如此强烈的社会禁忌来帮助确保生存。</p>

        <!-- <p>Cultures are not matters of taste but systems of adaptation to specific circumstances that may prove irrelevant or even counterproductive in other settings. Humans live in a wide variety of habitats. The wide number of potential niches in which we live require variations in behavior that are too complex to be informed by instinct. Therefore, behavior is culturally programmed. For the vast majority in many agricultural societies, culture programmed them for survival, but little more than survival in an environment where the luxury of participating in open markets was reserved to others.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>文化不是品味的问题，而是适应特定环境的系统，在其他环境中可能被证明是不相关的，甚至是适得其反的。人类生活在各种各样的栖息地。我们所处的大量潜在环境要求我们的行为发生变化，而这些变化太过复杂，无法由本能告知。因此，行为是由文化编程的。对于许多农业社会中的绝大多数人来说，文化为他们的生存进行了编程，但在参与公开市场的奢侈行为被保留给其他人的环境中，他们的生存也不过如此。</p>

        <!-- <p>Personal ability and personal choice—individual “pursuit of happiness,” in the modern sense—were suppressed by taboos and social restrictions that have always been most emphatic among the poor. Such restrictions were superseded only with great difficulty in societies with limited productivity. When and where agricultural productivity was higher, such as in ancient Greece, minor megapolitical revolutions occurred. Property took more modern forms. “Allod,” or freehold property, emerged. Lands tended to rent for a fixed fee, and the tenant absorbed the economic risk as well as a higher portion of the profit if the crop was good. Higher savings allow self-insurance of riskier behavior. Under such conditions, yeoman farmers could rise above the rank of peasantry and sometimes even accumulate independent wealth.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>个人能力和个人选择 —— 即现代意义上的个人『追求幸福』—— 被当作禁忌，被社会压制，而这些禁忌和限制在穷人中一直是最突出的。这种限制在生产力越有限的社会中越是突出。在农业生产力较高的地方，如古希腊，发生了小规模的政治革命。财产采取了更现代的形式。出现了『Allod』，即自由产权的财产。土地往往以固定的费用出租，承租人吸收经济风险，以及在作物良好的情况下吸收更高的利润部分。较高的储蓄允许对风险较大的行为进行自我保险。在这样的条件下，贵族农民可以超越农民的等级，有时甚至可以积累独立的财富。</p>

        <!-- <p>The tendency for more market-like property rights and relationships to develop near the top of an economic hierarchy or, in rarer cases, across the whole economy, as societies emerged from poverty, is an important characteristic of social organization. It is equally important to note that the most common organization of agricultural society historically has been essentially feudal, with market relations at the top and the closed village system at the bottom. The great mass of peasants were tied to the land in almost all premodern agricultural societies. So long as agricultural productivity remained low, or higher productivity was dependent upon access to centralized hydraulic systems, the freedom and property rights of individual farmers at the bottom remained minimal. In such conditions, feudal forms of property prevailed. Land was held by tenure rather than through freehold title. Typically, rights of sale, gift, and inheritance were restricted.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>随着社会摆脱贫困，更多类似市场的产权和关系在经济等级制度的顶端附近发展，或者在更罕见的情况下，在整个经济中发展，这是社会组织的一个重要特征。同样重要的是要注意到，历史上最常见的农业社会组织基本上是封建的，市场关系在顶层，封闭的村庄系统在底层。在几乎所有的前现代农业社会中，广大农民都被束缚在土地上。只要农业生产力仍然较低，或者较高的生产力取决于进入集中的水利系统，底层农民个人的自由和财产权仍然是最低的。在这种情况下，封建形式的财产普遍存在。土地是通过保有权而不是通过自由产权来持有的。通常情况下，出售、赠送和继承的权利受到限制。</p>

        <!-- <p>Feudalism in its various forms was not only a response to ever-present risks of predatory violence. It also was a reaction to appallingly low rates of productivity. The two have tended to go hand in hand in farming societies. Each frequently contributed to the other. When public authority collapsed, property rights and prosperity tended to recede accordingly. Collapsing productivity also tended to undermine authority. While not every drought or adverse climatic change resulted in the breakdown of public authority, many did.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>各种形式的封建主义不仅是对无处不在的掠夺性暴力风险的一种回应。它也是对令人震惊的低生产率的一种反应。在农耕社会中，这两者往往是相辅相成的。两者经常相互促进。当公共权力崩溃时，财产权和繁荣也会相应消退。崩溃的生产力也倾向于破坏权威。虽然不是每一次干旱或不利的气候变化都会导致公共权力的崩溃，但很多都是如此。</p>

In the first few centuries after the fall of Rome, the economy of Western Europe withered. The Germanic kingdoms that took root in the territories of the former Roman Empire had assumed many functions of the Roman state, but at a much less ambitious level. Infrastructure more or less went untended. As the centuries passed, bridges and aqueducts fell into disrepair and became unusable. Roman coinage was still employed, but it practically disappeared from circulation. Land markets, which had thrived in Roman times, more or less dried up. Towns, which had been centers of Roman administration, virtually vanished along with the taxing power of the state. And so did almost every other accoutrement of civilization.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>1000 年的变革就是如此，它启动了封建革命。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en14" id="text00009.html#ch03en14">14</a></sup>当时，跨政治和经济状况与我们所认为的中世纪的特征有很大不同。在罗马灭亡后的最初几个世纪里，西欧的经济萎靡不振。在前罗马帝国领土国家上扎根的日耳曼王国承担了罗马国家的许多职能，但其水平远不如罗马国家。基础设施或多或少地被忽视了。几个世纪过去了，桥梁和水渠年久失修，变得无法使用。罗马硬币仍在使用，但它实际上已从流通中消失了。在罗马时代兴盛的土地市场或多或少干涸了。作为罗马行政管理中心的城镇，几乎与国家的征税权一起消失了。几乎所有其他的文明装备也是如此。</p>

        <!-- <p>The “Dark Ages” were so named for a reason. Literacy became so rare that anyone who possessed the ability to read and write could expect immunity from prosecution for almost any crime, including murder. Artistic, scientific, and engineering skills that had been highly developed in Roman times disappeared. From road building to the grafting of vines and fruit trees, Western Europe ceased employing many techniques that had once been well known and practiced to a high standard. Even so ancient a device as the potter’s wheel disappeared in many places. Mining operations contracted. Metallurgy receded. Irrigation works in the Mediterranean region disintegrated through neglect.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en15" id="text00009.html#ch03en15">15</a></sup>As historian Georges Duby observed, “At the end of the sixth century, Europe was a profoundly uncivilized place.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en16" id="text00009.html#ch03en16">16</a></sup>Although there was a brief renaissance of central authority under the rule of Charlemagne around the year 800, everything soon devolved again after his death.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>『暗黑时代』如此命名是有原因的。识字率变得如此稀少，以至于任何拥有读写能力的人都指望着对几乎所有的罪行免于起诉，甚至包括谋杀。在罗马时代高度发展的艺术、科学和工程技能消失了。从道路建设到葡萄和果树的嫁接，西欧停止使用了许多曾经广为人知并达到高标准的技术。甚至像陶轮这样古老的设备也在许多地方消失了。采矿业萎缩了。冶金业退缩了。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en15" id="text00009.html#ch03en15">15</a></sup>正如历史学家乔治·杜比所观察到的那样，『在六世纪末，欧洲是一个极不文明的地方。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en16" id="text00009.html#ch03en16">16</a></sup>尽管在

        <!-- <p>A surprising corollary to this dreary landscape was the fact that the collapse of the Roman state probably raised the living standards of small farmers for several centuries. The Germanic kingdoms that dominated Western Europe during the Dark Ages incorporated some of the relatively easygoing social features common to their ancestral tribes, such as the legal equality of freeholders. As a consequence, small farmers in the Dark Ages were far freer than they were to be in the feudal centuries. By that we can also infer that they were more prosperous. As we analyzed above in exploring the logic of property forms under different conditions of productivity, freehold property has historically gone hand in hand with the relative prosperity of small farmers. The closed-village and feudal forms of property tended to emerge where the capacity of small farmers to make a living was more doubtful.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这种沉闷的景象的一个令人惊讶的推论是，罗马国家的崩溃在长达几个世纪之久的时间里，可能是反过来提高了小农的生活水平。在暗黑时代主宰西欧的日耳曼王国吸收了他们祖先部落常见的一些相对随和的社会特征，如自由民的法律平等。因此，暗黑时代的小农远比他们在封建时代要自由得多。通过这一点，我们也可以推断出，他们更加繁荣。正如我们在上面探讨不同生产力条件下的财产形式逻辑时分析的那样，自由财产在历史上与小农的相对繁荣相伴而行。在小农谋生能力比较可疑的地方，往往会出现封闭的村庄和封建的财产形式。</p>

        <!-- <p>To be sure, the virtual collapse of commerce during the Dark Ages cost small farmers the benefits of trade and advantages of wider markets. The demise of the towns undermined the cash economy, but it also meant the rural population was no longer called upon to support the crushing burden of bureaucracy. As Guy Bois has written, the Roman town was a parasitic community, not a center of production: “In the Roman period, the dominant function of a city was of a political order. It lived primarily from the revenues draining into it from its surroundings by the agency of the land tax.… The town, in effect, produced little or nothing for the benefit of the surrounding countryside.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en17" id="text00009.html#ch03en17">17</a></sup>The collapse of Roman authority largely freed farmers in the countryside from taxes, which had sucked away “between one quarter to one third of the gross product of the land, without counting the various exactions suffered by small and middling landowners.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en18" id="text00009.html#ch03en18">18</a></sup>The taxes were so onerous, sometimes enforced by execution, that desertion of property by owners was widespread. The barbarians mercifully allowed these taxes to lapse.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>可以肯定的是，暗黑时代商业的实际崩溃使小农失去了贸易的好处和更广泛市场的优势。城镇的消亡破坏了现金经济，但它也意味着农村人口不再被要求支持官僚机构的沉重负担。正如盖伊·博伊斯所写，『罗马城镇是一个寄生社区，而不是一个生产中心。在罗马时期，城市的主要功能是政治秩序。它主要靠土地税的代理机构从周围地区流入它的收入生活…… 实际上，城镇几乎不为周围农村的利益生产任何东西。』 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en17" id="text00009.html#ch03en17">17</a></sup>罗马当局的崩溃在很大程度上使农村的农民摆脱了税收，『税收吸走了土地总产值的四分之一到三分之一，还没有算上中小地主的各种征收。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en18" id="text00009.html#ch03en18">18</a></sup>这些税收是如此的繁重，有时需要通过处决才能执行，因此业主遗弃财产的现象非常普遍。所谓的野蛮人竟然仁慈地允许这些税收失效。</p>

        <h3>被遗弃的田地</h3>

        <!-- <p>The burdens of government were so greatly reduced by the barbarian conquests that an opening was created for the poor to obtain freehold property and keep it. Some of the <em>agri deserti,</em>or deserted farms abandoned by owners fleeing predatory taxation in the final years of the Roman Empire, were brought back into production. Notwithstanding the rude circumstances of the time and the fact that crop yields were ridiculously low by modern standards, the Dark Ages were a period of relative prosperity for Europe’s smallholders. In fact, they were in a stronger position than they would be again until the modern era. For one thing, fewer hands were available to till the fertile land, large tracts of which had gone out of cultivation. Plagues, wars, and abandonment by owners escaping the collapsing Roman Empire had significantly depopulated areas previously under cultivation. Another advantage enjoyed by small farmers in the Dark Ages arose from the adoption in the sixth century of new farming technology: the heavy plow, often mounted on wheels. Used in tandem with an improved harness that allowed peasants to employ multiple oxen, the new technology made it much easier to clear forested land in Northern Europe.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en19" id="text00009.html#ch03en19">19</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>政府的负担因野蛮人的征服而大为减轻，从而为穷人获得自由财产和保持财产创造了机会。在罗马帝国的最后几年里，很多曾经是为了逃避掠夺性税收而被业主遗弃的荒废的田地被被买回，重新投入生产。尽管当时的环境恶劣，而且按现代标准，作物产量低得离谱，但暗黑时代对欧洲的小农来说是一个相对繁荣的时期。事实上，他们的地位比他们在现代之前的地位还要高。首先，可用来耕种肥沃土地的人越来越少，大片土地已经不再耕种。瘟疫、战争和退出崩溃的罗马帝国的所有者的遗弃，使以前的耕种区人口大幅减少。小农在暗黑时代享有的另一个优势是在六世纪采用了新的农业技术：通常安装在轮子上的重型犁。新技术与允许农民使用多头牛的改进型马具一起使用，使得在北欧清除林地变得更加容易。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en19" id="text00009.html#ch03en19">19</a></sup></p>

        <p>然而，随着暗黑时代的到来，发生了几件事情，使那些在罗马灭亡后继承了政权的日耳曼王国的贵族农民和自由人的独立关系变得不稳定：</p>

        <!-- <p>1. Populations gradually recovered, placing greater pressures on the use of land. Over several centuries, much of the most fertile of the unclaimed land was brought into production, engendering growth in Northern Europe in particular. The increasing population of farmers relative to the supply of land made the labor of each farmer worth less. Most freehold titles were broken into ever smaller plots through inheritance. During the Dark Ages, children tended to share equally in the estates of their parents. The fragmentation of holdings at a time of rising population tended to place land at a premium once again and led to the re-emergence of active land markets by the mid-tenth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>1. 人口逐渐恢复，对土地的使用产生了更大的压力。几个世纪以来，许多最肥沃的无主土地被投入生产，特别是在北欧产生了增长。相对于土地供应，农民人口的增加使得每个农民的劳动价值降低。大多数自由所有权通过继承被分割成越来越小的地块。在暗黑时代，孩子们倾向于平等地分享他们父母的财产。在人口不断增加的情况下，土地的分散往往会使土地再次升值，并导致在十世纪中期重新出现活跃的土地市场。</p>

        <!-- <p>2. In the final decades of the tenth century, temperatures suddenly turned colder, with a devastating impact on farm output. Three successive crop failures led to severe famine from 982 to 984. Famine struck again after another crop failure in 994.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en25" id="text00009.html#ch03en25">25</a></sup>Then, in 997, the problem of falling crop yields was compounded by a plague, which struck small family holdings with particular force because the smallholders lacked the resources to replace labor supplied by lost family members. These clustered crop failures and disasters at first led the yeoman farmers to sink into debt. When yields failed to recover they could not pay their mortgages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>2. 在十世纪的最后几十年里，气温突然变冷，对农业产出产生了毁灭性的影响。从 982 年到 984 年，连续三次作物歉收导致了严重的饥荒。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en25" id="text00009.html#ch03en25">25</a></sup>然后，在 997 年，作物产量下降的问题因一场瘟疫而变得更加复杂，这对小型家庭财产的打击特别大，因为小农户缺乏资源来替代失去家庭成员的劳动力。这些成群结队的农作物歉收和灾难起初导致贵族农民陷入债务困境。当产量无法恢复时，他们就无法支付抵押贷款。</p>

Although knights remained the lowest rank of the upper class, knighthood acquired a unique cachet that made knighting an honor prized by the great nobility and even royalty. The cachet was primarily the product of the Church’s policy of Christianizing knighthood by sanctifying the ceremony of knighting and by sponsoring a code of behavior known as chivalry, a code perhaps violated more often than honored, but exercising incontestable influence on the thought and conduct of posterity.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en26" id="text00009.html#ch03en26">26</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

This further improved the durability of the horse on the road.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en27" id="text00009.html#ch03en27">27</a></sup>Also adding to the improved effectiveness of the armed knight were the contoured saddle, which made it easier to wield heavy weapons, the spur, and the curb bit, which enabled a rider to control the horse with one hand while fighting.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en28" id="text00009.html#ch03en28">28</a></sup>Together, these apparently minor technological innovations dramatically devalued the military importance of the smallholders, who could not afford to maintain war-horses and arm themselves. The cheaper of the horses specially bred for war, the large chargers known as <em>destriers,</em>were worth four oxen or forty sheep. The more expensive warhorses cost ten oxen or one hundred sheep.

        <!-- <p>The unsettled conditions of the late tenth century paved the way for the feudal revolution. Clustered crop failures and disasters led the yeoman farmers to sink into debt. When crop yields failed to recover, the freeholders faced a desperate situation. Markets always place the greatest pressures on the weakest holders. Indeed, that is part of their virtue. They promote efficiency by removing assets from weak hands. But in late-tenth-century Europe, subsistence farming was practically the only occupation. Families who lost their land lost their only means of survival. Faced with this unpalatable prospect, many or most of the freehold farmers decided to give away their fields during the feudal revolution. In the words of Guy Bois, “The only sure way for a peasant to hold on to the land he tilled was to concede ownership of it to the Church, so he could retain its usufruct.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en30" id="text00009.html#ch03en30">30</a></sup>Others ceded some or all of their land to wealthier farmers in whom they had confidence, either friendly neighbors or relatives.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>十世纪末的不稳定状况为封建革命铺平了道路。成片的作物歉收和灾难导致贵族农民陷入债务。当农作物产量未能恢复时，自由人面临着绝望的境地。市场总是把最大的压力放在最弱的持有人身上。事实上，这也是其优点的一部分。它们通过将资产从弱者手中移走来提高效率。但在十世纪末的欧洲，自给自足的农业几乎是唯一的职业。失去土地的家庭失去了他们唯一的生存手段。面对这种令人不快的前景，许多或大多数自由职业者决定在封建革命期间放弃他们的田地。用盖伊·博伊斯的话说，『农民要想守住自己耕种的土地，唯一可靠的办法就是把土地的所有权让给教会，这样他就可以保留土地的用益权。』"<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en30" id="text00009.html#ch03en30">30</a></sup>其他人则把部分或全部土地让给他们信任的富农，他们或是友邻或是亲戚。</p>

        <!-- <p>These property transfers were made on the condition that the farmer, his family, and his descendants were to remain to work the fields. The poor farmers were also to enjoy the reciprocal support of the more substantial holders, now the “nobles” who were able to afford horse and armor, and thus provide protection to the enlarged estates. Such a bargain can be seen from the new serf’s point of view as a halfway station between continuing economic ownership and foreclosure. More often than not, it was a bargain he could not refuse.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这些财产转让的条件是，农民、他的家人和他的后代必须留在田里工作。贫穷的农民也将享受到更多持有者的对等支持，现在是『贵族』，他们有能力购买马匹和盔甲，从而为扩大的庄园提供保护。从新农奴的角度来看，这样的交易可以看作是持续的经济所有权和取消赎回权之间的一个中转站。更多的时候，这是一个他无法拒绝的交易。</p>

        <!-- <p>Falling productivity not only placed poor farmers in a desperate economic dilemma; it also instigated an upsurge in predatory violence that undermined the security of property. Those without the resources to wrest a share of the available and inadequate supply of horses and fodder suddenly found that they and their property were no longer safe. To put their dilemma in contemporary terms, it was as if you were forced to arm yourself today with a new type of weapon, but the cost of doing so was $100,000. If you could not pay that price, you would be at the mercy of those who could.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>生产力的下降不仅使贫穷的农民陷入了绝望的经济困境；它还激起了掠夺性暴力的激增，破坏了财产的安全。那些没有资源从现有的、不足的马匹和饲料供应中分一杯羹的人突然发现，他们和他们的财产不再安全。用当代的话来说，他们的困境就像今天你被迫用一种新型武器武装自己，但这样做的代价是 10 万美元。如果你不能支付这个价格，你就会受到那些能支付的人的摆布。</p>

        <!-- <p>Within a few years, the capacity of the king and the courts to enforce order collapsed.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en31" id="text00009.html#ch03en31">31</a></sup>Anyone with armor and a horse could now become a law unto himself. The result was a late-tenth-century version of <em>Blade Runner,</em>a melee of fighting and plunder that the constituted authorities were powerless to stop. Looting and attacks by armed knights disrupted the countryside. It is by no means obvious, however, that all the victims of this pillage were the poor. To the contrary, the elderly, physically weaker, or ill-prepared among the larger landholders made more attractive targets. They had more to steal.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>It was not a coincidence that this happened at the very moment when colder weather, famine, and plague were placing a pinch on resources. The megapolitical conditions conducive to the breakdown of authority had been in place for some time. Their potential for altering the power relations in society was not realized, however, until a crisis was triggered. Crop failures and famines appear to have done just that. While the exact sequence of events is difficult to reconstruct, it appears that the looting was instigated, at least in part, by desperate conditions. Once the violence was unleashed, it became evident that no one could mobilize the force to stop it. The vast majority of poorly armed farmers certainly could do little. Even dozens of farmers on foot would have been outmatched by a single armed knight on horseback. The freehold farmers, like the constituted authorities, the kings with their counts, were powerless to prevent local land from being seized by armed warriors.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <h3>上帝的安宁</h3>

        <!-- <p>In these desperate conditions, the Church helped to launch feudalism through its efforts to negotiate a truce in the violent countryside. Historian Guy Bois described the situation this way: “The impotence of the political authorities was such that the Church stood in for them in the attempt to restore order, in the movement known as ‘The Peace of God.’ ‘Councils of Peace’ proclaimed series of interdictions which were sanctioned by anathemas; vast ‘assemblies of peace’ received the oaths of the warriors. The movement originated in the French Midi (Council of Charroux in 989, Council of Narbonne in 990), then gradually spread.…”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en32" id="text00009.html#ch03en32">32</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在这种绝望的情况下，教会通过努力在暴力的乡村中谈判达成休战，帮助启动了封建主义。历史学家盖伊·博伊斯这样描述当时的情况。『政治当局无能为力，教会在被称为「上帝的和平」的运动中代替他们试图恢复秩序。和平会议宣布了一系列禁令，这些禁令得到了圣谕的认可；庞大的和平大会接受了骑士们的宣誓。这场运动起源于法国中部地区（989 年的夏鲁斯会议，990 年的纳邦会议），然后逐渐蔓延……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en32" id="text00009.html#ch03en32">32</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>The bargain that the Church struck involved acknowledgment of the overlordship of armed knights in local communities in exchange for a cessation or tempering of the violence and looting. Land titles inscribed after the surge of violence in the late tenth century suddenly bore the title “nobilis” or “miles” as an indication of lordship. The nobility as a separate estate was created by the feudal revolution. Property transactions recorded to the same individuals only a few years earlier had listed no such distinction.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en33" id="text00009.html#ch03en33">33</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>教会达成的交易涉及承认武装骑士在当地社区的霸主地位，以换取暴力和掠夺的停止或缓和。在十世纪末暴力事件激增之后，刻下的土地所有权突然出现了『nobilis』或『miles』之类的头衔，作为领主地位的标志。贵族作为一个独立的产业是由封建革命产生的。仅在几年前，记录在案的相同个人的财产交易没有列出这种区别。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en33" id="text00009.html#ch03en33">33</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Given falling productivity and the economic insecurity of the smallholders, the megapolitical power of the armed knights led inevitably to property holdings by feudal tenure. By the end of the first quarter of the eleventh century, yeoman farmers had largely disappeared. Their freeholdings had shrunk to a fraction of their previous extent and were now being worked just part-time. The small farmers or their descendants were serfs who spent most of their time laboring on the estates of feudal lords, lay and ecclesiastical.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>鉴于生产力下降和小农的经济不安全，武装骑士的跨政治力量不可避免地导致了封建使用权的财产占有。到十一世纪第一季度末，贵族农民基本上已经消失了。他们的自由所有权已经缩减到以前的一小部分，现在只是在做兼职。小农或他们的后代成了农奴，他们大部分时间都在封建领主（非宗教人士和教会人士）的庄园里劳动。</p>

        <!-- <p>The breakdown of order that accompanied the feudal revolution led to adjustments in behavior which reinforced feudalism. Among them was a surge in castle building. Castles had first appeared in northwest Europe as primitive wooden structures in the wake of Viking raids in the ninth century. Originally command centers for Carolingian officials, they became hereditary possessions after the feudal revolution. These early redoubts were far more primitive than they would later become, but they were nonetheless difficult to attack. Once erected, castles were razed only with the greatest effort. As they began to dot the countryside, the castles made it ever more implausible that the king or his counts could effectively challenge the local supremacy of the lords.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>伴随着封建革命的秩序崩溃导致了行为的调整，从而加强了封建主义。其中包括城堡建设的热潮。城堡最早出现在欧洲西北部，是九世纪维京人袭击后的原始木质结构。城堡最初是卡洛林王朝官员的指挥中心，封建革命后成为世袭的财产。这些早期的堡垒比后来的要原始得多，但它们还是很难被攻击。城堡一旦建立起来，只有用最大的努力才能被夷为平地。当它们开始遍布乡村时，城堡使国王或他的伯爵们曾经能够有效地挑战当地领主的最高地位开始变得越来越不可信。</p>

        <!-- <p>1. In an environment where military power was decentralized, the Church was uniquely placed to maintain peace and develop rules of order that transcended fragmented, local sovereignties. This is a job that no secular power was positioned to do. The observations of the great religious authority A. R. Radcliffe-Brown are directly relevant here. He pointed out that “the social function of a religion is independent of its truth or falsity.” Even those that are “absurd and repulsive, such as those of some savage tribes, may be important and effective parts of the social machinery.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en34" id="text00009.html#ch03en34">34</a></sup>This was certainly the case with the Church in the early stages of feudalism. It helped create rules, as only a religion could, that enabled people to overcome incentive traps and behavioral dilemmas. Some of these were moral dilemmas common to all human life. But others were local dilemmas, unique to the prevailing megapolitical conditions. The medieval Church had a special role to play in restoring order in the countryside in the final years of the tenth century. By providing religious and ceremonial support to local authorities, the Church lowered the costs of establishing at least weak local monopolies of violence. By helping to establish order in this way, the Church contributed to the conditions that ultimately led to more stable configurations of power.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>1. 在军事力量分散的环境中，教会在维护和平和制定超越零散的地方主权的秩序规则方面具有独特的地位。这是一项任何世俗权力都无法胜任的工作。伟大的宗教权威 A. R. Radcliffe-Brown 的意见在此直接相关。他指出，『一种宗教的社会功能与它的真假无关』。即使是那些『荒谬和令人厌恶的宗教，如一些野蛮部落的宗教，也可能是社会机制的重要和有效部分。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en34" id="text00009.html#ch03en34">34</a></sup>在封建主义的早期阶段，教会肯定是这种情况。它帮助建立了只有宗教才有的规则，使人们能够克服激励的陷阱和行为的困境。其中一些是所有人类生活中常见的道德困境。但也有一些是地方性的困境，在当时的跨政治条件下是独一无二的。在十世纪的最后几年，中世纪教会在恢复农村秩序方面发挥了特殊作用。通过向地方当局提供宗教和仪式上的支持，教会降低了建立至少是薄弱的地方暴力垄断的成本。通过以这种方式帮助建立秩序，教会为最终导致更稳定的权力配置创造了条件。</p>

        <!-- <p>The Church continued to play a role for a long time thereafter in tempering the private wars and excesses of violence that otherwise could not be contained by civil authorities. The relative importance of the Church as opposed to secular authorities is reflected in the fact that by the eleventh century, the main administrative division of authority in most of Western Europe came to be the parish, rather than the old divisions of civil authority, the <em>ager</em>and <em>pagus</em> (town) that had persisted from Roman times through the Dark Ages.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en35" id="text00009.html#ch03en35">35</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>此后很长一段时间里，教会继续发挥着抑制私人战争和过度暴力的作用，否则民间当局就无法遏制这种现象。教会相对于世俗当局的重要性体现在，到十一世纪，西欧大部分地区的主要行政权力划分是教区，而不是从罗马时代到暗黑时代一直存在的旧的民事权力划分，即 <em>ager</em> 和 <em>pagus</em>（都是「镇」，大小不同而已）。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en35" id="text00009.html#ch03en35">35</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>2. The Church was the main source for preserving and transmitting technical knowledge and information. The Church sponsored universities and provided the minimal education that medieval society enjoyed. The Church also provided a mechanism for reproducing books and manuscripts, including almost all contemporary information about farming and husbandry. The <em>scriptoria</em>of the Benedictine monasteries can be understood as an alternate technology to printing presses, which did not yet exist. Costly and inefficient as the scriptoria were, they were practically the only mechanism for reproducing and preserving written knowledge in the feudal period.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>2. 教会是保存和传播技术知识和信息的主要来源。教会赞助大学，提供中世纪社会所享有的最低限度的教育。教会还提供了一个复制书籍和手稿的机制，包括几乎所有关于农耕和畜牧业的当代信息。本笃会修道院的经书抄写室可以被理解为印刷术的一种替代技术，当时还没有印刷术。尽管文字抄写成本高、效率低，但它们实际上是封建时期复制和保存书面知识的唯一机制。</p>

        <!-- <p>3. Partly because its farm managers were literate, the Church did a great deal to help improve the productivity of European farming, especially in the early stages of feudalism. Before the thirteenth century the farm managers of lay lords were almost all illiterates who kept records through an elaborate set of marks. Shrewd farmers though they may have been, they were in no position to benefit from any improvement in production methods that they could not invent themselves or see with their own eyes. The Church was therefore essential to improving the quality of grains, fruits, and breeding stock. Because of its extensive holdings spread over the entire European continent, the Church could send the most productive seed and breeding stock to areas where output lagged. The demand for sacramental wine in Northern Europe led monks to experiment with hardier varieties of grape that could survive in colder climates. The Church also helped raise the productivity of medieval farming in other ways. Many of the uneconomically small plots donated to the Church during the feudal revolution were reconfigured to make them easier to farm. The Church also provided ancillary services required by small farming communities. In many areas, Church-owned mills ground grain into flour.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>3. 部分由于其农场经理是识字的，教会在帮助提高欧洲农业的生产力方面做了大量工作，特别是在封建主义的早期阶段。在十三世纪之前，非宗教人士领主的农场经理几乎都是文盲，他们通过一套精心设计的标记来保持记录。尽管他们可能是精明的农民，但他们无法从任何他们自己发明或亲眼看到的生产方法的改进中获益。因此，教会对于提高谷物、水果和种畜的质量至关重要。由于其广泛的财产分布在整个欧洲大陆，教会可以将产量最高的种子和种群送到产量落后的地区。北欧对圣酒的需求促使修士们尝试种植更耐寒的葡萄品种，以便在更寒冷的气候中生存。教会还以其他方式帮助提高了中世纪农业的生产力。许多在封建革命期间捐给教会的不经济的小块土地被重新配置，使其更容易耕种。教会还提供小型农业社区所需的辅助服务。在许多地区，教会拥有的磨坊将谷物磨成面粉。</p>

        <!-- <p>4. The Church undertook many functions that are today absorbed by government, including the provision of public infrastructure. This is part of the way that the Church helped overcome what economists call “public goods dilemmas” in an era of fragmented authority. Specific religious orders of the early-medieval Church devoted themselves to applied engineering tasks, like opening roads, rebuilding fallen bridges, and repairing dilapidated Roman aqueducts. They also cleared land, built dams, and drained swamps. A new monastic order, the Carthusians, dug the first “artesian” well in Artois, France. Using percussion drilling, they dug a small hole deep enough to create a well that needed no pump.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en36" id="text00009.html#ch03en36">36</a></sup>The
Cistercian Order undertook to build and maintain precarious seawalls and dikes in the Low Countries of Europe. Farmers deeded land to Cistercian monasteries and then leased it back, while the monks undertook full responsibility for upkeep
and repairs. Cistercians also took the lead in developing water-powered machines, which were adopted to such widespread uses as “pounding, lifting, grinding, and pressing.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en37" id="text00009.html#ch03en37">37</a></sup>The
monastery of Clairvaux dug a two-mile-long canal from the River Aube.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en38" id="text00009.html#ch03en38">38</a></sup>The Church also intervened to build new roads and bridges where population centers had shifted
outside the range of the old Roman garrison roads. Bishops granted indulgences to local lords who would build or repair river crossings and maintain hospices for travelers. An order of monks established by St. Bénezet, the Frères Pontifes,
or “Brothers of the Bridge,” built several of the longest bridges then existing, including the Pont d’Avignon, a massive twenty-arch structure over the Rhone with a combination chapel and tollbooth at one end. Even London Bridge, which stood
until the nineteenth century, was constructed by a chaplain and financed in part by a contribution of 1,000 marks from the papal legate.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en39" id="text00009.html#ch03en39">39</a></sup></p>
<span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>4. 教会承担了许多今天被政府吸收的职能，包括提供公共基础设施。这是教会在一个权力分散的时代帮助克服经济学家所说的『公共物品困境』的部分方式。中世纪早期教会的特定宗教团体致力于应用工程任务，如开辟道路、重建倒塌的桥梁和修复破旧的罗马水渠。他们还开垦土地，建造水坝，排泄沼泽。一个新的修道会，即卡尔图斯会，在法国的阿图瓦挖出了第一口『自流井』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en36" id="text00009.html#ch03en36">36</a></sup>西多会承担了在欧洲低地国家修建和维护不稳定的海堤和堤坝的工作。农民将土地租给西多会的修道院，然后再租回来，而僧侣们则承担起维护和修理的全部责任。西多会还率先开发了以水为动力的机器，这些机器被广泛用于『敲打、提升、研磨和压制』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en37" id="text00009.html#ch03en37">37</a></sup>克莱沃的修道院从奥布河挖出一条两英里长的运河。
            <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en38" id="text00009.html#ch03en38">38</a></sup>在人口中心已经转移到旧罗马驻军道路范围之外的地方，教会也进行干预，建造新的道路和桥梁。主教们向那些修建或维修河流渡口并为旅行者维持安养院的当地领主发放了赦免令。由圣贝内泽建立的修士会，即『桥之兄弟』，建造了当时最长的几座桥，包括阿维尼翁桥，这是一座横跨罗纳河的巨大的 20 个拱形结构，一端有一个小教堂和收费站。甚至直到十九世纪的伦敦桥，也是由一位牧师建造的，部分资金来自教皇遗嘱的
            1000 马克。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en39" id="text00009.html#ch03en39">39</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>5. The Church also helped incubate a more complex market. Cathedral construction, for example, differs in kind from public infrastructure, like bridges and aqueducts. In principle, at least, Church structures were used only for religious services and not as thoroughfares for commerce. Yet it should not be forgotten that construction of churches and cathedrals helped create and deepen markets for many artisanal and engineering skills. In the same way that military spending of the nation-state during the Cold War unintentionally helped incubate the Internet, so the building of medieval cathedrals led to spin-offs of other kinds, the incubation of commerce. The Church was a principal customer of the building trades and artisans. Church purchases of silver for communion services, candelabra, and artworks to decorate churches helped to create a market for luxury goods that otherwise would not have existed.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>5. 教会还帮助孵化了一个更复杂的市场。例如，大教堂的建造在种类上不同于公共基础设施，如桥梁和水渠。至少在原则上，教会建筑只用于宗教服务，而不是作为商业的通道。然而，我们不应忘记，教堂和大教堂的建设有助于创造和深化许多工匠和工程技能的市场。就像冷战期间领土国家的军事开支无意中帮助孵化了互联网一样，中世纪大教堂的建设也导致了其他类型的衍生产品，即商业的孵化。教会是建筑行业和工匠的主要客户。教会购买用于圣餐仪式的银器、烛台和装饰教堂的艺术品，有助于创造一个奢侈品市场，否则就不会有这种市场。</p>

        <!-- <p>In many ways, the Church helped to temper the ferocity of violence unleashed by armed knights during and after the “feudal revolution.” Especially in the early centuries of feudalism, the Church contributed significantly to improving the productivity of the farming economy. It was an essential institution, well fitted to the needs of agrarian society at the close of the Dark Ages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在许多方面，教会帮助缓和了武装骑士在『封建革命』期间和之后所释放的凶猛暴力。特别是在封建主义的早期几个世纪，教会为提高农业经济的生产力做出了重大贡献。它是一个重要的机构，很适合暗黑时代结束时农业社会的需要。</p>

        <h3>对暴力的脆弱性</h3>

        <!-- <p>In “thirty or forty years of violent disturbances, the feudal revolution of the year 1000,”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en40" id="text00009.html#ch03en40">40</a></sup>like the fall of Rome five centuries earlier, was a unique event, caused by a complex interplay of influences. Yet in one respect, the triumph of <em>mali homines</em> (wicked men) and the oppressions they wrought perfectly reflect the essential vulnerability of agricultural society to violence. In contrast to the foraging phase of human existence, farming introduced a quantum leap in organized violence and oppression.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>『三四十年的暴力骚乱中，发生在 1000 年的封建革命』，<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en40" id="text00009.html#ch03en40">40</a></sup>与五个世纪前罗马的衰落一样，是一个独特的事件，由复杂的影响因素相互作用造成。然而，在一个方面，<em>mali homines</em>（恶人）的胜利和他们造成的压迫完美地反映了农业社会对暴力的基本脆弱性。与人类生存的觅食阶段相比，农业在有组织的暴力和压迫方面有了质的飞跃。</p>

        <!-- <p>From the very earliest, this was reflected in the more militant cultures of farming peoples. The gods of the early agricultural societies were gods of rainfall and flooding, whose functions reflected the preoccupations of those societies with factors that determined crop yields. The sender of rain or water was also often the god of war, invoked by the earliest kings, who were, above all else, warlords.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en41" id="text00009.html#ch03en41">41</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>从最早期开始，这就反映在农耕民族更为激进的文化中。早期农业社会的神是降雨和洪水之神，其功能反映了这些社会对决定作物产量的因素的关注。雨水或水的发源地的神，往往也是战争之神，最早的国王都会召唤它，他们首先是军阀。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en41" id="text00009.html#ch03en41">41</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>The close connection between farming and warfare was reflected in the religious imagination of people whose lives were transformed by the innovations of the agricultural revolution. The expulsion from the Garden of Eden can be seen as a figurative account of the transformation of society from foraging to farming, from a free life with food picked from nature’s bounty with little work to a life of hard labor.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>农耕和战争之间的密切联系反映在人们的宗教想象力中，他们的生活被农业革命的创新所改变。被逐出伊甸园可以被看作是社会从觅食到耕作的转变的形象化描述，从不费吹灰之力就能从大自然的恩赐中采摘食物的自由生活到艰苦劳动的生活。</p>

        <!-- <h2>PARADISE LOST</h2><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>Farming set humanity on an entirely new course. The first farmers truly planted the seeds of civilization. From their toil came cities, armies, arithmetic, astronomy, dungeons, wine and whiskey, the written word, kings, slavery, and war. Yet notwithstanding all the drama that farming was to add to life, the shift away from the primeval economy appears to have been roundly unpopular from its earliest days. Witness the account preserved in the Book of Genesis, which tells the story of the expulsion from paradise. The biblical parable of the Garden of Eden is a fond recollection of the life of ease enjoyed by the forager in the wilderness. Scholars indicate that the word “Eden” appears to be derived from a Sumerian word for “wilderness.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en42" id="text00009.html#ch03en42">42</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <p>The transition from a free and sparsely settled life in the wild to a sedentary life in a farming village was a matter of deep regret, expressed not only in the Bible but also in humankind’s continuing grudge against getting up in the morning and going to work. As Stephen Boyden wrote in <em>Western Civilization in Biological Perspective,</em>the new way of living that accompanied farming was “evodeviant.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en43" id="text00009.html#ch03en43">43</a></sup>Prior to the advent of farming, thousands of human generations lived as Adam did in Eden, at the invitation of his Maker: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat.” Hunters and gatherers had no crops to tend, no herd to watch, no taxes to pay. Like hoboes, foragers drifted where they pleased, worked little, and answered to no one.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>从自由而稀少的野外生活过渡到农业村落的定居生活是一个令人深感遗憾的问题，这不仅表现在《圣经》中，也表现在人类对早晨起床和上班的持续怨恨中。正如斯蒂芬·博伊登（<em>Stephen Boyden</em>）在《生物学视角下的西方文明》（<em>Western Civilization in Biological Perspective</em>）一书中写道，伴随着农耕的新生活方式是『开始偏离的』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch03-en43" id="text00009.html#ch03en43">43</a></sup>在农耕出现之前，成千上万的人类世代像亚当那样生活在伊甸园，接受造物主的邀请。『园中各样的树，你都可以随便吃』。猎人和采集者没有庄稼需要照料，没有牛群需要看管，没有税收需要支付。像无业游民一样，觅食者随心所欲地漂流，工作很少，而且不对任何人负责。</p>

        <!-- <p>With farming, a new way of life began, and on altogether more pressing terms. “Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” Farming was hard work. The memory of life before farming was that of paradise lost.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>随着农业的发展，一种新的生活方式开始了，而且条件更加紧迫。『荆棘和蒺藜也要给你生出来，你要吃田里的草，你要在脸上流汗吃饼』。耕作是艰苦的工作。人们对农耕之前的生活的记忆是失去的天堂。</p>

        <!-- <p>More than they could have imagined, farmers created new conditions that drastically altered the logic of violence. It is not a coincidence that the Book of Genesis makes Cain, the first murderer, “a tiller of the ground.” Indeed, it is part of the uncanny prophetic power of the Bible that its story was entrusted to shepherds who readily understood how farming gave leverage to violence. In a few verses the biblical account encapsulates logic that took thousands of years to play out. Farming was an incubator of disputes. Farming created stationary capital on an extensive scale, raising the payoff from violence and dramatically increasing the challenge of protecting assets. Farming made both crime and government paying propositions for the first time.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>农民创造了新的条件，极大地改变了暴力的逻辑，这超出了他们的想象。《创世记》将第一个杀人犯该隐称为『耕地的人』，这不是一个巧合。事实上，《圣经》的故事被委托给牧羊人，这是《圣经》不可思议的预言能力的一部分，他们很容易理解耕作是如何给暴力提供杠杆的。在短短的几节经文中，《圣经》的叙述概括了几千年来的逻辑。耕作是争端的孵化器。耕作创造了大规模的固定资本，提高了暴力的回报率，大大增加了保护资产的挑战。耕作首次使犯罪和政府都成为有价值的主张。</p>

        <!-- <p>To speak of the coming death of politics is bound to seem ridiculous or optimistic, depending on your disposition. Yet that is what the Information Revolution is likely to bring. For readers reared in a century saturated in politics, the idea that life could proceed without it may seem fanciful, the equivalent to claiming that one could live merely by absorbing nutrients from the air. Yet politics in the modern sense, as the preoccupation with controlling and rationalizing the power of the state, is mostly a modern invention. We believe it will end with the modern world just as the tangle of feudal duties and obligations that engrossed the attentions of people in the Middle Ages ended with the Middle Ages. During the feudal period, as historian Martin van Creveld points out, “politics did not exist (the very concept had yet to be invented, and dates back only to the sixteenth century).”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en2" id="text00010.html#ch04en2">2</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>说到政治即将消亡，肯定会让人觉得很荒谬或很乐观，这取决于你的心态。然而，这正是信息革命可能带来的结果。对于生长在一个充满政治的世纪里的读者来说，没有政治的生活可以继续下去的想法可能看起来很虚幻，相当于声称一个人仅仅通过吸收空气中的营养就可以生存。然而，现代意义上的政治，作为对国家权力的控制和合理化的关注，主要是一种现代发明。我们相信，它将随着后现代世界的到来而结束，就像中世纪人们所关注的封建责任和义务的纠葛随着中世纪的到来而结束一样。在封建时期，正如历史学家马丁·范·克里夫德所指出的，『政治并不存在（这一概念尚未被发明，只能追溯到十六世纪）。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en2" id="text00010.html#ch04en2">2</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>The thought that politics, as we now know it, did not exist prior to the modern period may seem surprising, especially given that Aristotle had written an essay of that title in the days of Alexander the Great. But look closely. Words used in ancient texts are not necessarily contemporary concepts. Aristotle also wrote an essay entitled <em>Sophistical Refutations,</em>a term about as meaningless today as <em>Politics</em>was in the Middle Ages. The word simply was not in use. Its first known appearance in English dates to 1529.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en3" id="text00010.html#ch04en3">3</a></sup>Even then, “politics” appears to have been a pejorative, derived from an Old French word, <em>politique,</em>used to describe “opportunists and temporizers.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en4" id="text00010.html#ch04en4">4</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们现在所知道的政治，在近代之前并不存在，这种想法似乎令人惊讶，特别是考虑到亚里士多德在亚历山大大帝时代就写过一篇这样的文章。但仔细看看。古代文本中使用的词语不一定是当代概念。亚里士多德还写了一篇题为 <em>Sophistical Refutations</em> 的文章，这个词在今天就像 <em>Politics</em> 在中世纪一样毫无意义。这个词当时根本没有被使用。它第一次在英语中出现是在 1529 年。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en3" id="text00010.html#ch04en3">3</a></sup>即使在那时，『政治』似乎也是一个贬义词，源于一个旧法语单词

        <!-- <p>It took almost two thousand years for Aristotle’s latent concept to emerge with the meaning we now know. Why? Before the modern world could put Aristotle’s word to a meaningful use, megapolitical conditions were required that dramatically raised the returns to violence. The Gunpowder Revolution, which we analyzed in <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>did just that. It raised the returns to violence far above what they had ever been. This made the question of who controlled the state more important than it had ever been. Logically and inevitably, politics emerged from the struggle to control the sharply increased spoils of power.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>亚里士多德的潜在概念用了近两千年的时间才出现了我们现在所知道的含义。为什么呢？在现代世界能够将亚里士多德的词用于有意义的用途之前，需要有巨大的政治条件，那就是暴力的回报要有极大的提高。我们在《大清算》中分析的火药革命就做到了这点。它使暴力的回报率远远高于以往的水平。这使得谁控制国家的问题比以往任何时候都更加重要。从逻辑上讲，政治不可避免地出现在为控制急剧增加的权力战利品而进行的斗争中。</p>

That will come later. It has not yet occurred to most of your contemporaries that a life without politics is possible. What we have in the final years of the twentieth century is inarticulate disdain.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>对腐败领导人的道德愤怒不是一种孤立的历史现象，而是变革的常见先兆。每当一个时代让位给另一个时代时，这种现象就会一再发生。每当技术变革使旧的形式脱离新的经济运动力量时，道德标准就会发生变化，人们开始越来越不屑于对待那些旧机构的指挥者。这种普遍的反感在人们形成一种新的、连贯的变革意识形态之前就已经显现出来了。在我们写这篇文章的时候，还没有什么证据表明人们对政治的明确拒绝。这将在以后出现。你们同时代的大多数人还没有想到，没有政治的生活是可能的。在二十世纪的最后几年，我们所拥有的是不明确的蔑视。</p>

        <!-- <p>Something similar happened in the late fifteenth century, but at that time it was religion rather than politics that was in the process of being downsized. Notwithstanding popular belief in “the sacredness of the sacerdotal office,”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en6" id="text00010.html#ch04en6">6</a></sup>both the higher and lower ranks of clergy were held in the utmost contempt —not unlike the popular attitude toward politicians and bureaucrats today. It was widely believed that the upper clergy were corrupt, worldly, and venal. And not without reason. Several fifteenth-century popes openly sported bastards. The lower clergy were held in even lower esteem as they proliferated in country and town, begging for alms and frequently offering to sell God’s grace and the forgiveness of sins to anyone who would put cash into the bargain.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>类似的事情也发生在十五世纪末，但当时正在缩小规模的是宗教而不是政治。尽管人们相信『圣职的神圣性』，<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en6" id="text00010.html#ch04en6">6</a></sup>高级和低级的神职人员都受到了极大的蔑视 —— 与今天人们对政治家和官僚的态度并不一样。人们普遍认为上层神职人员是腐败的、世俗的和腐败的。而且不是没有原因的。十五世纪的几位教皇都公开拥有私生子。下层神职人员的地位甚至更低，他们在乡下和城里泛滥成灾，乞求施舍，并经常向任何愿意投入现金的人兜售上帝的恩典和罪孽的赦免。</p>

        <!-- <p>Beneath the “crust of superficial piety”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en7" id="text00010.html#ch04en7">7</a></sup>was a corrupt and increasingly dysfunctional system. Many lost respect for those who ran it, long before anyone dared to say that it did not work. A life saturated with religion, making no distinction between the spiritual and the temporal, had exhausted its possibilities. Its end was inevitable long before Luther nailed his 95 theses on the church door at Wittenberg.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在『表面虔诚的外壳』之下<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en7" id="text00010.html#ch04en7">7</a></sup>是一个腐败和日益失调的系统。许多人对管理它的人失去了尊重，早在有人敢于说它压根就不起作用之前。充满宗教的生活，不区分精神和世俗的生活，已经耗尽了它的可能性。早在路德将他的 95 条论文钉在维登堡的教堂门上之前，它的结局就已经不可避免了。</p>

        <!-- <p>We believe that the reaction against saturation politics is following a similar path. The death of the Soviet Union and the repudiation of socialism are part of a broad pattern of depoliticization sweeping the world. This is now most evident in a growing contempt for those who run the world’s governments. It is driven only in part by the realization that they are corrupt, and prone to sell “indulgences” from political difficulty in exchange for campaign contributions or special help on commodity trades to subvene their personal finances.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>我们相信，对饱和政治的反应也在遵循类似的路径。苏联的死亡和对社会主义的否定是席卷全球的广泛的去政治化模式的一部分。这一点现在最明显地体现在人们对管理世界政府的人越来越轻视。 部分原因是人们认识到他们腐败，容易从政治困难中出售『放纵』，以换取竞选捐款或在商品交易中提供特殊帮助，从而为他们的个人财务提供资金。</p>

        <!-- <p>The reaction against politicians is also motivated by the widening realization that much of what they do at great cost is futile, in the same way that organizing another pilgrimage of penitents to march barefoot in the snow, or the founding of yet another order of mendicant monks in the late fifteenth century, could have done little to improve productivity or relieve pressures on living standards.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>对政治家的反应也是出于这样的认识：他们花大价钱做的很多事情都是徒劳的，就像在十五世纪末组织另一次忏悔者的朝圣之旅，在雪地上赤脚行进，或建立另一个修行僧团一样，对提高生产力或缓解生活水平的压力没有什么作用。</p>

        <h3>圣母教会的最后日子</h3>

        <!-- <p>At the end of the Middle Ages, the monolithic Church as an institution had grown senile and counterproductive, a marked change from its positive economic contribution five centuries earlier. As we explored in the last chapter, the Church played a leading role at the end of the tenth century in establishing order and facilitating economic recovery from the anarchy that marked the close of the Dark Ages. At that time, the Church was indispensable to the survival of large numbers of small freeholders and serfs who made up the bulk of the Western European population. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Church had become a major drag upon productivity. The burdens it imposed upon the population were pushing living standards down.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在中世纪末，作为一个机构铁板一块的教会已经变得衰老并产生了反作用，这与它在五个世纪前的积极经济贡献有了明显的变化。正如我们在上一章中所探讨的那样，教会在十世纪末在建立秩序和促进经济从暗黑时代结束时的无政府状态中恢复方面发挥了主导作用。当时，教会对于构成西欧大部分人口的大量小自由主和农奴的生存是不可或缺的。到了十五世纪末，教会已经成为生产力的主要阻力。它强加给人们的负担使生活水平下降。</p>

        <!-- <p>Much the same thing can be said of the nation-state today. It was a necessary adaptation to the new megapolitical conditions created by the Gunpowder Revolution five centuries ago. The nation-state widened the scope of markets and displaced fragmented local authorities at a time when more encompassing trading areas brought large returns. The fact that merchants almost everywhere in Europe spontaneously allied themselves to the monarch at the center as he maneuvered to consolidate authority is itself telling evidence that the nation-state in its early form was good for business. It helped lift the burdens on commerce imposed by feudal landlords and local magnates.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>今天的领土国家也可以说是如此。它是对五个世纪前火药革命所创造的新的跨政治条件的必要适应。领土国家扩大了市场的范围，并取代了分散的地方当局，当时，更多的贸易区带来了巨大的回报。欧洲几乎所有地方的商人都自发地与中央的君主结盟，因为他要巩固权威，这一事实本身就说明了领土国家的早期形式对商业是有利的。它有助于解除封建地主和地方豪强对商业的负担。</p>

        <!-- <p>In a world where returns to violence were high and rising, the nation-state was a useful institution. But five centuries later, as this millennium draws to a close, megapolitical conditions have changed. Returns to violence are falling, and the nation-state, like the Church at the twilight of the Middle Ages, is an anachronism that has become a drag on growth and productivity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>在一个暴力回报率高且不断上升的世界中，领土国家是一个有用的机构。但五个世纪后，随着这个千年期的结束，跨政治条件已经发生了变化。暴力的回报率正在下降，领土国家就像中世纪末的教会一样，是一个不合时宜的东西，已经成为增长和生产力的阻力。</p>

        <!-- <p>Like the Church then, the nation-state today has exhausted its possibilities. It is bankrupt, an institution grown to a senile extreme. Like the Church then, it has served as the dominant form of social organization for five centuries. Having outlived the conditions that brought it into existence, it is ripe for a fall. And fall it will. Technology is precipitating a revolution in the exercise of power that will destroy the nation-state just as assuredly as gunpowder weapons and the printing press destroyed the monopoly of the medieval Church.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>就像当年的教会一样，今天的领土国家已经耗尽了它的可能性。它已经破产了，是一个成长到衰老的极端的机构。就像当年的教会一样，它作为社会组织的主导形式已经存在了五个世纪。在超越了使其存在的条件之后，它已经成熟，可以堕落了。而它也将倒下。技术正在催生一场行使权力的革命，它将摧毁领土国家，就像火药武器和印刷术摧毁中世纪教会的垄断一样肯定。</p>

        <!-- <p>If our reasoning is correct, the nation-state will be replaced by new forms of sovereignty, some of them unique in history, some reminiscent of the city-states and medieval merchant republics of the premodern world. What was old will be new after the year 2000. And what was unimaginable will be commonplace. As the scale of technology plunges, governments will find that they must compete like corporations for income, charging no more for their services than they are worth to the people who pay for them. The full implications of this change are all but unimaginable.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>如果我们的推理是正确的，领土国家将被新的主权形式所取代，其中有些是历史上独一无二的，有些让人想起前现代世界的城邦和中世纪的商业共和国。2000 年之后，旧的东西将变成新的。难以想象的东西将成为普遍现象。随着技术规模的急剧下降，政府将发现他们必须像公司一样为收入而竞争，对他们的服务所收取的费用不能超过他们对支付这些服务的人的价值。这种变化的全部影响都是无法想象的。</p>

        <!-- <h2>THIN AND NOW</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>过去和现在</h2>

        <!-- <p>Something similar might have been said five hundred years ago, at the turn of the fifteenth century. Then as now, Western civilization stood at the threshold of a momentous transformation. Although almost no one knew it, medieval society was dying. Its death was neither widely anticipated nor understood. Nonetheless, the prevailing mood was one of deep gloom. This is common at the end of an era, as conventional thinkers sense that things are falling apart, that “the falcon cannot hear the falconer.” Yet their mental inertia is often too great to comprehend the implications of the emerging configurations of power. Medieval historian Johan Huizinga wrote of the waning days of the Middle Ages, “The chroniclers of the fifteenth century have, nearly all, been the dupes of an absolute misappreciation of their times, of which the real moving forces escaped their attention.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en8" id="text00010.html#ch04en8">8</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>五百年前，在十五世纪之交，人们可能会说类似的话。当时和现在一样，西方文明正站在一个重大变革的门槛上。尽管几乎没有人知道，中世纪社会正在消亡。它的死亡既没有被广泛预期，也没有被理解。然而，普遍的情绪是一种深深的忧郁。这在一个时代结束时很常见，因为传统的思想家们感觉到事情正在崩溃，『猎鹰听不到猎鹰人的声音』。然而，他们的思维惯性往往太大，无法理解新出现的权力配置的含义。中世纪历史学家约翰·惠津加（<em>Johan Huizinga</em>）在谈到中世纪的衰落时写道：『十五世纪的编年史家几乎都是对其时代绝对错误理解的上当者，其中真正的运动力量逃脱了他们的注意。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en8" id="text00010.html#ch04en8">8</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <h3>Myths Betrayed</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>被背叛的神话</h3>

        <!-- <p>Major changes in the underlying dynamics of power tend to confound conventional thinkers because they expose myths that rationalize the old order but lack any real explanatory power. At the end of the Middle Ages, as now, there was a particularly wide gap between the received myths and reality. As Huizinga said of the Europeans in the late fifteenth century, “Their whole system of ideas was permeated by the fiction that chivalry ruled the world.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en9" id="text00010.html#ch04en9">9</a></sup>This has a close second in the contemporary assumption that it is ruled by votes and popularity contests. Neither proposition stands up to close scrutiny. Indeed, the idea that the course of history is determined by democratic tallies of wishes is every bit as silly as the medieval notion that it is determined by an elaborated code of manners called chivalry.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>权力的基本动力的重大变化往往会迷惑传统的思想家，因为它们暴露了使旧秩序合理化但缺乏任何真正解释力的神话。在中世纪末，和现在一样，所接受的神话和现实之间存在着特别大的差距。正如惠津加在谈到十五世纪末的欧洲人时所说，『他们的整个思想体系被骑士精神统治世界的虚构所渗透。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en9" id="text00010.html#ch04en9">9</a></sup>这在当代的假设中紧随其后，即由选票和人气竞赛来统治。这两个命题都经不起仔细的推敲。事实上，认为历史的进程是由民主的愿望统计决定的想法，就像中世纪的观念一样愚蠢，即，历史是由称为骑士精神的精心设计的礼仪规范决定的。</p>

        <!-- <p>The fact that saying so borders on heresy suggests how divorced conventional thinking is from a realistic grasp of the dynamics of power in late industrial society. It is an issue we examine closely in this book. In our view, voting was an effect rather than a cause of the megapolitical conditions that brought forth the modern nation-state. Mass democracy and the concept of citizenship flourished as the nation-state grew. They will falter as the nation-state falters, causing every bit as much dismay in Washington as the erosion of chivalry caused in the court of the duke of Burgundy five hundred years ago.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这样的说法接近于异端邪说，这表明传统思维与对晚期工业社会中权力动态的现实把握有多大的差距。这是我们在本书中仔细研究的一个问题。在我们看来，投票是产生现代领土国家的跨政治条件的一个结果，而不是一个原因。大众民主和公民权的概念随着领土国家的发展而繁荣。它们将随着领土国家的衰落而衰落，在华盛顿引起的惊愕程度不亚于五百年前勃艮第公爵的宫廷中骑士精神的消退。</p>

        <!-- <h2>PARALLELS BETWEEN CHIVALRY AND CITIZENSHIP</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h2>骑士精神与公民身份之间的关系</h2>

        <!-- <p>If you can understand how and why the importance of chivalric oaths faded away with the transition to an industrial organization of society, you will be better positioned to see how citizenship as we now know it could fade away in the Information Age. Both served a similar function. They facilitated the exercise of power under two quite different sets of megapolitical conditions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>如果你能理解骑士精神誓言的重要性是如何以及为什么随着社会向工业组织的过渡而逐渐消失的，你就能更好地理解我们现在所知的公民身份是如何在信息时代逐渐消失的。两者都有类似的功能。它们在两套完全不同的跨政治条件下促进了权力的行使。</p>

        <!-- <p>Feudal oaths prevailed at a time when defensive technology was paramount, sovereignties were fragmented, and private individuals and corporate bodies exercised military power in their own right. Before the Gunpowder Revolution, wars had normally been fought by small contingents of armed men. Even the most powerful monarchs did not have <em>militum perpetuum,</em>or standing armies. They drew their military support from their vassals, the greater lords, who in turn drew upon their vassals, the lesser lords, who in turn drew upon <em>their</em>vassals, the knights. The whole chain of allegiance carried down the hierarchy to the person of the meanest social standing who was considered worthy to bear arms.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>封建誓言盛行的时候，防御性技术是最重要的，主权是分散的，私人和公司机构以自己的权利行使军事权力。在火药革命之前，战争通常是由小型武装人员组成的特遣队进行的。即使是最强大的君主也没有常备军。他们从其附庸，即大领主那里获得军事支持，而大领主又从其附庸，即小领主那里获得军事支持，小领主又从其附庸，即骑士那里获得军事支持。整个效忠链沿着等级制度向下延伸，直到最卑微的社会地位的人被认为有资格携带武器。</p>

        <!-- <h3>Uniforms or Divergences?</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>制服或分歧</h3>

        <!-- <p>Unlike a modern army, a medieval army before the rise of citizenship did not march on the field of battle outfitted in uniforms. To the contrary, each retainer or vassal, each knight, baronet, or lord of different degree had his own distinctive livery that reflected his place in the hierarchy. Instead of uniforms, there were divergences that emphasized the vertical structure of society in which each station was different. As Huizinga said, medieval warriors were distinguished by “outward signs of… divergences: liveries, colors, badges, party cries.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en10" id="text00010.html#ch04en10">10</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>与现代军队不同，在公民权兴起之前的中世纪军队并没有穿着制服在战场上行军。相反，每个家臣或附庸，每个骑士、男爵或不同等级的领主都有自己独特的制服，以反映其在等级制度中的地位。与其说是制服，不如说是强调了社会的垂直结构，在这个结构中，每个职位都是不同的。正如惠钦加所说，中世纪的战士是通过『…… 分歧的外在标志来区分的：服装、颜色、徽章、党的呼声。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en10" id="text00010.html#ch04en10">10</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Nor were wars fought only by governments or nations. As Martin van Creveld has pointed out, modern notions of war, as stylized by strategists like Carl von Clausewitz, misrepresent the reality of premodern conflict. Van Creveld writes:</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Among them were barbarian tribes, the Church, feudal barons of every rank, free cities, even private individuals. Nor were the “armies” of the period anything like those we know today; indeed, it is difficult to find a word that will do them justice.

        <p>在这种情况下，对领主来说，他的家臣真正『穿上军装，跟在后面』显然是至关重要的。因此，骑士精神的誓言受到了高度重视。</p>

        <!-- <p>The honor of the medieval knight and the duty of the conscript soldier served parallel functions. The medieval man was bound by oaths to individuals and the Church in much the way that moderns are bound by citizenship to the nation-state. Violating an oath was the medieval equivalent of treason. People in late-medieval times went to extremes to avoid violating oaths, just as millions of modern citizens went to extremes in the World Wars, charging machine-gun nests to fulfill their duties as citizens.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>中世纪骑士的荣誉和应征士兵的义务具有平行的功能。中世纪的人被对个人和教会的誓言所约束，就像现代人被对领土国家的公民身份所约束一样。违反誓言就相当于中世纪的叛国罪。中世纪晚期的人们为了避免违反誓言而走极端，就像数百万现代公民在世界大战中走极端一样，为了履行公民的义务而冲向机枪巢穴。</p>

        <!-- <p>Both chivalry and citizenship added an extra dimension to the simple calculus that would otherwise deter unindoctrinated human beings from going onto a battlefield and staying there when the going got rough. Chivalry and citizenship both led people to kill and to risk death. Only demanding and exaggerated values that are strongly reinforced by leading institutions can serve that function.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>骑士精神和公民身份都为简单的计算方法增加了一个额外的维度，否则，未受教育的人就会被阻止上战场，并在情况不妙时留在那里。骑士精神和公民意识都引导人们去杀人，去冒死。只有那些被领导机构大力强化的苛刻而夸张的价值观才能发挥这种功能。</p>

        <!-- <h3>Circumventing Cost-Benefit Analysis</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>规避成本·效益分析</h3>

        <!-- <p>The success and survival of any system depends upon its capacity to marshal military effort in times of conflict and crisis. Obviously, the decision on the part of a medieval knight or a private in the trenches in World War I to risk his life in battle was not likely to be informed by a sober, cost-benefit calculation. Seldom are wars so easily fought, or do rewards for those who bear the brunt of the fighting so far overshadow the possible costs that an army of economic optimizers could be recruited to rush out to the battlefield. Almost every war and, indeed, most battles have moments in which the tide could turn on a heartbeat. As students of military history are well aware, the difference between defeat and victory is often told by the valor, bravery, and ferocity with which individual soldiers take up their task. If the men doing the fighting are not willing to die over a piece of ground that would not be worth a fig once the battle stops, then they probably will not prevail against an otherwise evenly matched foe.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>任何系统的成功和生存都取决于其在冲突和危机时调集军事力量的能力。显然，中世纪的骑士或第一次世界大战中战壕里的士兵不可能通过冷静的成本效益计算来决定在战斗中冒生命危险。很少有战争是那么容易打的，也很少有那些首当其冲的人的回报远远超过了可能的成本，以至于可以招募一支经济优化者的军队赶赴战场。几乎每一场战争，事实上，大多数战役都有可能在一瞬间扭转局势的时刻。研究军事历史的学生都很清楚，失败和胜利之间的区别往往是由个别士兵的英勇、勇敢和凶猛来决定的。如果打仗的人不愿意为一块一旦停止战斗就一文不值的土地而牺牲，那么他们很可能无法战胜势均力敌的敌人。</p>

        <!-- <p>This has important implications. The more effective sovereignties are in limiting defections and encouraging military effort, the more likely they are to prevail militarily. In warfare, the most useful value systems induce people to behave in ways that short-term rational calculation would rule out. No organization could mobilize military power effectively if the individuals it sent into battle felt free to calculate where their own best advantage lay, and join in the fight or run away accordingly. If so, they would almost never fight. Only under the most propitious circumstances, or the most desperate, would the rational person care to engage in a potentially lethal battle based upon short-term cost-benefit analysts. Perhaps <em>Homo economicus</em>might fight on a sunny day, when the forces on his side were overwhelming, the enemy weak, and the potential rewards of battle enticing. Perhaps. He might also fight if backed into a corner by marauding cannibals.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>这具有重要的意义。在限制叛逃和鼓励军事努力方面，主权国家越是有效，它们就越有可能在军事上取得胜利。在战争中，最有用的价值体系会诱导人们采取短期理性计算所不可能采取的行为。如果被派往战场的人能够自由地计算自己的最佳优势在哪里，并相应地加入战斗或逃跑，那么任何组织都无法有效地调动军事力量。如果是这样，他们几乎永远不会战斗。只有在最有利的情况下，或者在最绝望的情况下，理性的人才会根据短期的成本效益分析，关心参与一场可能致命的战斗。也许『经济人』可能会在一个晴朗的日子里战斗，那时他这边的力量是压倒性的，敌人是弱小的，而且战斗的潜在回报是诱人的。也许。如果被劫掠的食人族逼到墙角，他也可能会战斗。</p>

        <blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：<strong>经济人</strong>（<em>Economic man</em>，拉丁语：<em>Homo oeconomicus</em>），又称作『经济人假设』，即假定人思考和行为都是目标理性的，唯一地试图获得的经济好处就是物质性补偿的最大化。 这常用作经济学和某些心理学分析的基本假设。</blockquote>

        <!-- <p>But those are extreme circumstances. What of the more common conditions of warfare, which are neither so attractive that they would pass the scrutiny of cost-benefit analysis nor so desperate that they afford no way out? It is here that concepts like chivalry and citizenship are important contributors to the successful use of military power. Long before a battle begins, predominant organizations must convince individuals that upholding certain duties to the lord, or the nation-state, are more important than life itself. The myths and rationalizations that societies employ to encourage risk-taking on the battlefield are a key part of their military prowess.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>但这些都是极端情况。那么，更常见的战争情况呢？这些情况既没有吸引力，以至于无法通过成本效益分析的审查，也没有绝望，以至于没有出路。正是在这里，像骑士精神和公民意识这样的概念是成功使用军事力量的重要促成因素。早在战斗开始之前，占主导地位的组织必须说服个人，坚持对领主或领土国家的某些义务比生命本身更重要。社会为鼓励在战场上冒险而采用的神话和合理化建议是其军事能力的一个关键部分。</p>

        <!-- <p>To be effective, these myths must be tailored to the prevailing megapolitical conditions. The fiction that chivalry rules the world means nothing today, especially in a city like New York. But it was the cherished myth of feudalism. It justified and rationalized the ties of obligation that bound everyone under the domination of the Church and a warlike nobility. At a time when private wars of covetousness were commonplace,<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en12" id="text00010.html#ch04en12">12</a></sup>the exercise of power and the very survival of individuals depended upon the willingness of others to fulfill their promises of military service under conditions of duress. It was obviously crucial that those promises be dependable.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>为了有效，这些神话必须适合当时的跨政治条件。骑士精神统治世界的虚构在今天毫无意义，尤其是在纽约这样的城市。但它是封建主义所珍视的神话。它证明了义务关系的合理性，这种关系将每个人都束缚在教会和好战贵族的统治之下。在一个贪婪的私人战争司空见惯的时代，<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en12" id="text00010.html#ch04en12">12</a></sup>权力的行使和个人的生存取决于其他人是否愿意在胁迫的条件下履行他们服兵役的承诺。显然，这些承诺必须是可靠的。</p>

        <h3>国籍之前</h3>

        <!-- <p>Unlike today, the concept of nationality played little or no role in establishing sovereignty in the Middle Ages. Monarchs, as well as some princes of the Church and powerful lords, possessed territories by private right. In a way that has no modern analogy, these lords could sell or give away territories or acquire new ones by conveyance or marriage as well as by conquest. Today, you could hardly imagine the United States falling under the sovereignty of a non-English-speaking Portuguese president because he happened to marry the former American president’s daughter. Yet something similar was commonplace in medieval Europe. Power passed by hereditary descent. Cities and countries changed sovereigns the way that antiques change owners. In many cases, sovereigns were not native to the regions in which their properties lay. Sometimes they did not speak the local language, or spoke it badly with heavy accents. But it made little difference to the ties of personal obligation whether a Spaniard was king of Athens, or an Austrian was king of Spain.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>与今天不同，在中世纪，国籍的概念在建立主权方面几乎没有发挥任何作用。君主，以及一些教会的王子和有权势的领主，通过私人权利拥有领土国家。以一种现代无法比拟的方式，这些领主可以通过转让或婚姻以及征服的方式出售或赠送领土国家或获得新的领土国家。今天，你很难想象美国会因为一位不讲英语的葡萄牙总统碰巧娶了美国前总统的女儿而落入他的主权范围。然而，类似的事情在中世纪的欧洲是很常见的。权力通过世袭血统传递。城市和国家像古董更换主人一样更换主权者。在许多情况下，君主并不是其财产所在地区的本地人。有时他们不会说当地的语言，或者说得很差，口音很重。但是，无论西班牙人是雅典的国王，还是奥地利人是西班牙的国王，这对个人义务的联系都没有什么区别。</p>

        <p>圣殿骑士团、圣约翰骑士团、条顿骑士团和马耳他骑士团等宗教团体也曾行使过主权。虽然马耳他骑士团仍然存在，而且在我们写这篇文章时，他们正准备恢复对马耳他圣安杰洛堡的主权，但这种混合机构在现代没有对应的机构。他们将宗教、社会、司法和金融活动与对地方的主权结合起来。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en13" id="text00010.html#ch04en13">13</a></sup>虽然他们行使领土国家管辖权，但他们几乎与今天的政府相反，因为国籍在动员其支持或其治理计划中不起作用。这些宗教团体的成员和官员来自基督教欧洲的所有地区，或被称为『基督教世界』。</p>

        <!-- <p>No one thought it appropriate or necessary that those who ruled be drawn from the local populations. The mobilization of support in the fragmented medieval scheme of governance did not depend upon a national identity or duty to the state, as in modern times, but upon personal loyalty and customary ties that had to be upheld as a matter of personal honor. Oaths to uphold these duties could be sworn by anyone from anywhere provided he was otherwise deemed worthy by his station in life.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

        <!-- <h3>The Vow</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
        <h3>誓言</h3>

        <!-- <p>Chivalric vows bound individuals to one another and were sworn on the honor of those who were parties to them. As Huizinga wrote, “in making a vow, people imposed some privation upon themselves as a spur to accomplishment of the actions they were pledged to perform.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en14" id="text00010.html#ch04en14">14</a></sup>So much importance was placed upon honoring vows that people frequently risked death or suffered serious privations in order to avoid breaking their vows. Often, the oaths themselves bound individuals to perform as matters of honor acts that would probably seem ludicrous to you and most readers of this book.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>骑士精神的誓言将人与人之间联系在一起，并且是以当事人的荣誉而宣誓的。正如惠钦加所写的那样，『在立下誓言时，人们将一些困难强加给自己，作为完成他们所承诺的行动的动力。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en14" id="text00010.html#ch04en14">14</a></sup>人们如此重视遵守誓言，以致人们经常冒着死亡或遭受严重困难，以避免违背誓言。通常情况下，誓言本身将个人的行为作为荣誉事项进行约束，而这些行为在你和本书的大多数读者看来可能是可笑的。</p>

        <!-- <p>For example, the Knights of the Star swore an oath never to retire “more than four acres from the battlefield, through which rule soon afterwards more than ninety of them lost their lives.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en15" id="text00010.html#ch04en15">15</a></sup>The prohibition on even tactical retreat is irrational as a military strategy. But it was a common imperative of the chivalric vows. Before the Battle of Agincourt, the king of England issued an order that knights on patrol should remove their armor, on grounds that it would have been incompatible with their honor to withdraw from enemy lines if they were wearing their coat armor. It so happened that the king himself got lost and passed by the village that had been night quarters for the vanguard of his army. Since he was wearing armor, his chivalric honor forbade him to simply turn around when he discovered his mistake and return to the village. He spent the night in an exposed position.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>例如，星辰骑士团曾发誓永不退却，『从战场上退却的面积超过 4 英亩，不久之后，他们中的 90 多人因这一规则而丧生。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en15" id="text00010.html#ch04en15">15</a></sup>作为一项军事战略，禁止战术性撤退也是不合理的。但这是骑士精神誓言的一个共同要求。在阿金库尔战役之前，英国国王发布了一项命令，要求巡逻的骑士们脱掉盔甲，理由是如果他们穿着大衣盔甲，从敌军阵地上撤退是与他们的荣誉不相符的。碰巧，国王本人也迷路了，经过了他的军队先锋队的夜宿村庄。由于他穿着盔甲，他的骑士荣誉感禁止他在发现自己的错误时简单地转身返回村庄。他在暴露的位置上过了一夜。</p>

        <!-- <p>As silly as this example seems, King Henry probably did not miscalculate in thinking that he would have risked more in trespassing his honor by retreating, and thus setting a demoralizing example for his entire army, than he did by sleeping behind enemy lines.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>尽管这个例子看起来很傻，但亨利国王可能没有计算错误，他认为自己如果通过撤退来侵犯自己的荣誉，会为整个军队树立了一个打击士气的榜样，这比他在敌后睡觉的风险更大。</p>

        <!-- <p>The history of the Middle Ages is filled with examples of prominent people fulfilling pledges that would seem ridiculous to us. In many cases, the actions proposed involved no objective connection to any benefit other than a vivid demonstration of the importance those undertaking them placed upon the vow itself. Among the common vows: to keep one eye closed, to eat and drink only when standing, and to become a self-imposed cripple by entering a one-person chain gang. There was a widespread custom of wearing painful foot irons. If today you saw someone struggling along the street in a heavy leg iron, you would probably assume that he was insane, not that he was a man of great virtue. Yet in the context of chivalry, willingly donning such a device was a badge of honor. And there were many similar customs that would seem equally ludicrous today. As Huizinga describes it, many took a pledge “not to sleep in a bed on Saturday, not to take animal food on Friday, etc. One act of asceticism is heaped upon another: one nobleman promises to wear no armor, to drink no wine one day in every week, not to sleep in a bed, not to sit down to meals, to wear the hair shirt<em>,”</em><sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en16" id="text00010.html#ch04en16">16</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>中世纪的历史充满了杰出人物履行承诺的例子，这些承诺在我们看来是荒谬的。在许多情况下，所提出的行动与任何利益没有任何客观联系，只是生动地展示了承诺者对誓言本身的重视。常见的誓言包括：闭上一只眼睛，只在站立时吃喝，以及通过自残加入某个团伙。当时有一个普遍的习俗，就是戴着痛苦的脚镣。如果今天你看到有人戴着沉重的脚镣在街上挣扎，你可能会认为他疯了，而不是认为他是一个有伟大品德的人。然而在骑士精神的背景下，心甘情愿地戴上这样的装置是一种荣誉的标志。还有许多类似的习俗，在今天看来也同样是可笑的。正如
            Huizinga 所描述的那样，许多人发誓『周六不睡床，周五不吃动物食物，等等。一种禁欲主义的行为堆积在另一种行为之上：一个贵族承诺不穿盔甲，每周有一天不喝酒，不睡在床上，不坐下来吃饭，穿毛衣……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en16" id="text00010.html#ch04en16">16</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Many enthusiasts for vows formed orders that placed particularly difficult privations on their members as tests of honor. The Order of Galois and Galoises, for example, dressed during summers in “furs and fur-lined hoods and lighted a fire in the hearth, whereas in winter they were only allowed to wear a simple coat without fur; neither mantles, not hats, nor gloves, and had only very light bed clothes.” As Huizinga reports, “It is not surprising that a great many members died of cold.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en17" id="text00010.html#ch04en17">17</a></sup>.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

By then, careful breeding had finally produced a battle horse sixteen hands high, a steed with the stature to carry comfortably a mounted knight in full armor. Yet “perfection,” as C.

            <!-- <h3>War at a Higher Scale</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>更大规模的战争</h3>

            <!-- <p>How did gunpowder weapons precipitate such a transformation? For one thing, they raised the scale of fighting, which meant that waging war soon became far more costly than it had been during the medieval period. Before the Gunpowder Revolution, wars had normally been fought by groups so small that they could be levied over a small and poor territory. Gunpowder gave a new advantage to fighting on a larger scale. Only leaders with claims on rich subjects could afford to field effective forces under the new conditions. Those leaders who best accommodated the growth of commerce, usually monarchs who allied themselves with the urban merchants, found that they enjoyed a competitive advantage on the battlefield. In van Creveld’s words, “thanks in part to the superior financial resources at their disposal, they could purchase more cannon than anybody else and blast the opposition to pieces.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en22" id="text00010.html#ch04en22">22</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>火药武器是如何促成这种转变的？首先，它们提高了战斗的规模，这意味着发动战争的代价很快就比中世纪时期的代价大得多。在火药革命之前，战争通常是由很小的团体进行的，以至于他们可以在一个小而贫穷的领土国家上征税。火药为更大规模的战斗提供了新的优势。在新的条件下，只有那些对富有的臣民有要求的领导人才有能力派出有效的部队。那些最能适应商业发展的领导人，通常是那些与城市商人结盟的君主，发现他们在战场上享有竞争优势。用范克里夫德的话说，『部分归功于他们所掌握的优越的财政资源，他们可以比别人购买更多的大炮，把对手炸得粉碎。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en22" id="text00010.html#ch04en22">22</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Even though it would be centuries before the full logic of gunpowder weapons would be unleashed in the citizen armies of the French Revolution, an early hint of the transformation of warfare by gunpowder was the adoption of military uniforms in the Renaissance. The uniforms aptly symbolize the new relations between the warrior and the nation-state that went hand in hand with the transition from chivalry to citizenship. In effect, the new nation-state would strike a “uniform” bargain with its citizens, unlike the special, divergent bargains struck by the monarch or the pope with a long chain of vassals under feudalism. In the old system, everyone had a different place in an architectonic hierarchy. Everyone had a bargain as unique as his coat of arms and the colorful pennants he flew.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管火药武器的全部逻辑在法国大革命的公民军队中释放出来还要等上几个世纪，但火药对战事转变的一个早期信号是文艺复兴时期对军服的采用。军装恰当地象征了战士和领土国家之间的新关系，这种关系与从骑士精神到公民身份的转变相辅相成。实际上，新的领土国家将与它的公民达成『统一』的交易，而不像封建主义下君主或教皇与一长串诸侯达成的特殊、不同的交易。在旧制度下，每个人在建筑等级制度中都有一个不同的位置。每个人都有一个独特的交易，就像他的纹章和他悬挂的彩色旗帜一样。</p>

            <!-- <p>Gunpowder weapons radically altered the nature of society in yet another way. They separated the exercise of power from physical strength, thereby lowering the opportunity costs of mercantile activity. Rich merchants no longer had to depend upon their own finesse and strength in hand-to-hand combat or on mercenaries of uncertain loyalty to defend themselves. They could hope to be defended by the new, larger armies of the great monarchs.

Most people five centuries ago viewed their changing society in static terms. As Huizinga said, “Very little property is, in the modern sense, liquid, while power is not yet associated predominantly with money; it is still rather inherent in the person and depends on a sort of religious awe which he inspires; it makes itself felt by pomp and magnificence, or a numerous train of faithful followers. Feudal or hierarchic thought expresses the idea of grandeur by visible signs.…”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en24" id="text00010.html#ch04en24">24</a></sup>Because people in the late Middle Ages thought before all else of status, they were ill-prepared to comprehend that merchants could possibly contribute anything of importance to the life of the realm. Almost without exception, merchants were commoners. They fit at the bottom of the three estates, below the nobility and the clergy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>就像今天大多数人没有准备好预测信息社会的新动态一样，中世纪社会的主要思想家们也无法预测或理解商业的兴起，而商业在塑造现代社会中发挥了如此重要的作用。五个世纪前的大多数人都以静态的眼光看待他们不断变化的社会。正如 Huizinga 所说：『在现代意义上，很少有财产是流动的，而权力还不是主要与金钱联系在一起的；它仍然是与生俱来的，取决于他所激发的某种宗教敬畏；它通过华丽的外表或无数忠实的追随者来体现。封建或等级思想通过可见的标志来表达宏伟的理念……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en24" id="text00010.html#ch04en24">24</a></sup>由于中世纪后期人们首先想到的是地位，他们没有准备好理解商人可能对王国的生活做出任何重要贡献。几乎毫无例外，商人都是平民。他们处于三种财产的底层，低于贵族和神职人员。</p>

The eclipse of feudalism marked the onset of the great modern phase of Western predominance. It was a period of rising returns to violence and rising scale in enterprise. For the past two and a half centuries, the modern economy has delivered an unparalleled rise in living standards for that fraction of the world that enjoyed its greatest benefits.

            <!-- <h3>The First Industrial Technology</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>第一种工业技术</h3>

            <!-- <p>Just as the cannon was opening new economic horizons, the printing press opened new intellectual horizons. It was the first machine of mass production, a signature technology that marked the onset of industrialism. In saying this, we share the view advanced by Adam Smith in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>that the Industrial Revolution had already happened well before he wrote. It had not reached maturity, to be sure, but the principles of mass production and the factory system were well established. His famous example of the pin manufacturers makes this case. Smith explains how eighteen separate operations are employed to produce pins. Because of specialized technology and the division of labor, each employee could make 4,800 times more pins in a day than an individual could fabricate on his own.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en28" id="text00010.html#ch04en28">28</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如大炮开辟了新的经济领域一样，印刷术也开辟了新的知识领域。它是第一台大规模生产的机器，是标志着工业主义开始的标志性技术。说到这里，我们赞同亚当·斯密在《国富论》中提出的观点，即工业革命早在他写作之前就已经发生。可以肯定的是，它还没有达到成熟的程度，但大规模生产和工厂系统的原则已经确立。他所举的著名的大头针制造商的例子就说明了这一点。史密斯解释了如何采用十八个独立的操作来生产销子。由于专门的技术和劳动分工，每个员工在一天内可以制造 4800 倍于一个人自己制造的大头针。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en28" id="text00010.html#ch04en28">28</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Smith’s example underscores the fact that the Industrial Revolution began centuries earlier than historians conventionally assume. Most textbooks would date its origins to the middle of the eighteenth century. That is not unreasonable as a date for the takeoff stage in the improvement of living standards. But the actual megapolitical transition between feudalism and industrialism began much earlier, at the end of the fifteenth century. Its impact was felt almost immediately in the transformation of dominant institutions, particularly in the eclipse of the medieval Church.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>史密斯的例子强调了这样一个事实：工业革命开始的时间比历史学家传统上认为的要早几个世纪。大多数教科书将其起源定为十八世纪中期。作为提高生活水平的起飞阶段的日期，这不是不合理的。但是，封建主义和工业主义之间的实际跨政治过渡开始得更早，在十五世纪末。它的影响几乎立即体现在主导机构的转变上，特别是中世纪教会的衰落。</p>

            <!-- <p>The historians who place the Industrial Revolution later are really measuring something else, the takeoff of living standards attributable to mass production powered by engines. This raised the value of unskilled labor and led to falling prices for a wide variety of consumer goods. Indeed, the fact that living standards began to rise sharply at different times in different countries is a tip-off that something other than the megapolitical transition is being measured. The <em>Cambridge Economic History of Europe</em>speaks of “Industrial Revolutions” in the plural, explicitly linking them to the sustained growth of national incomes.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en29" id="text00010.html#ch04en29">29</a></sup>In Japan and Russia, this income surge was delayed until the end of the nineteenth century. The rise in living standards and sustained growth of national income in other parts of Asia and some parts of Africa was a twentieth-century phenomenon. In some parts of Africa, sustained growth remains a dream to this day. But that does not mean that these regions are not living in the modern age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>那些把工业革命放在晚些时候的历史学家，实际上是在衡量其他东西，即由发动机驱动的大规模生产所带来的生活水平的飞跃。这提高了非熟练劳动力的价值，导致各种消费品的价格下降。事实上，不同国家的生活水平在不同时期开始急剧上升，这一事实提示我们，所衡量的不是跨政治转型，而是其他东西。《剑桥欧洲经济史》中提到了复数的『工业革命』，明确地将其与国民收入的持续增长联系起来。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en29" id="text00010.html#ch04en29">29</a></sup>在日本和俄国，这种收入的激增被推迟到了十九世纪末。亚洲其他地区和非洲一些地区生活水平的提高和国民收入的持续增长是二十世纪的现象。在非洲的一些地区，持续增长至今仍是一个梦想。但这并不意味着这些地区没有生活在现代社会中。</p>

            <!-- <p>The growth of income is not synonymous with the advent of industrialism. The shift to an industrial society was a megapolitical event, not measurable directly in income statistics. Indeed, real incomes for most Europeans fell for the first two centuries of the Industrial Age. They only began rising sometime after the beginning of the eighteenth century, and they did not recover to levels of 1250 until about 1750. We place the launch of the Industrial Age at the end of the fifteenth century. It was the industrial features of early-modern technology, including chemically powered weapons and printing presses, that precipitated the collapse of feudalism.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>收入的增长并不是工业主义出现的同义词。向工业社会的转变是一个巨大的政治事件，不能直接用收入统计来衡量。事实上，大多数欧洲人的实际收入在工业时代的前两个世纪都在下降。他们只是在十八世纪初的某个时候才开始上升，直到 1750 年左右才恢复到 1250 年的水平。我们把工业时代的启动时间放在十五世纪末。正是早期现代技术的工业特征，包括以化学为动力的武器和印刷机，促使了封建主义的崩溃。</p>

            <!-- <p>The capacity to mass-produce books was incredibly subversive to medieval institutions, just as microtechnology will prove subversive to the modern nation-state. Printing rapidly undermined the Church’s monopoly on the word of God, even as it created a new market for heresy. Ideas inimical to the closed feudal society spread rapidly, as 10 million books were published by the final decade of the fifteenth century. Because the Church attempted to suppress the printing press, most of the new volumes were published in those areas of Europe where the writ of established authority was the weakest. This may prove to be a close analogy with attempts by the U.S. government today to suppress encryption technology. The Church found that censorship did not suppress the spread of subversive technology; it merely assured that it was put to its most subversive use.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>大规模生产书籍的能力对中世纪的机构具有难以置信的颠覆性，就像微观技术（微处理器）将被证明对现代领土国家具有颠覆性一样。印刷术迅速破坏了教会对上帝之言的垄断，甚至为异端创造了一个新的市场。与封闭的封建社会相抵触的思想迅速传播，在十五世纪的最后十年里，有 1000 万本书出版。由于教会试图压制印刷业，大多数新书都是在欧洲那些既定权威的法令最弱的地区出版的。这可能被证明是与今天美国政府试图压制加密技术的做法相类似。教会发现，审查制度并没有抑制颠覆性技术的传播；它只是确保它被用于最具颠覆性的用途。</p>

            <h3>贬低寺院</h3>

            <!-- <p>Many apparently innocent uses of the printing press were subversive because of their content. Merely the spread of knowledge of the fortunes to be earned by intrepid adventurers and merchants was itself a powerful solvent dissolving the bonds of feudal obligation. The temptation of new markets, along with the need and opportunity to fund armies and navies on a larger scale, gave money a value it had lacked in the feudal centuries. These new avenues for investment, reinforced by powerful weapons that raised the returns to violence, made it increasingly costly to the lord in the hinterlands or the merchant in the city to donate his capital to the Church. Thus the very creation of investment opportunities outside of landholdings destabilized the institutions of feudalism and undercut its ideology.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>印刷术的许多表面上无害的用途因其内容而具有颠覆性。仅仅是传播关于无畏的冒险家和商人可以赚取财富的知识，本身就是一种强有力的溶剂，可以溶解封建义务的束缚。新市场的诱惑，以及大规模资助军队和海军的需要和机会，使货币具有了在封建世纪中所缺乏的价值。这些新的投资渠道，再加上提高暴力回报率的强大武器，使得内陆地区的领主或城市的商人向教会捐赠资本的成本越来越高。因此，在土地所有权之外创造的投资机会本身就破坏了封建制度的稳定，并削弱了其意识形态。</p>

            <!-- <p>Another subversive consequence of the printing press was its effect in dramatically lowering the costs of reproducing information. A crucial reason why literacy and economic progress had been so minimal during the Middle Ages was the high cost of duplicating manuscripts by hand. As we have seen, one of the major productive functions assumed by the Church after the fall of Rome was reproducing books and manuscripts in Benedictine monasteries. This was an extremely costly undertaking. One of the more dramatic consequences of printing was to devalue the scriptoria, where monks labored day after day, month after month to produce manuscripts that could be duplicated in hours by printing presses. The new technology made the Benedictine scriptorium an obsolete and costly means of reproducing knowledge. This, in turn, made the religious orders and the Church that sustained the scribes less economically important.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>印刷术的另一个颠覆性后果是它极大地降低了复制信息的成本。在中世纪，识字率和经济进步如此之低的一个重要原因是手工复制手稿的成本太高。正如我们所看到的，罗马沦陷后，教会承担的主要生产职能之一是在本笃会修道院复制书籍和手稿。这是一项成本极高的工作。印刷术的一个更戏剧性的后果是贬值，修士们日复一日、月复一月地劳作，制做出来的手稿可以在数小时内通过印刷机复制。新技术使本笃会的文字室成为一种过时的、昂贵的知识复制手段。这反过来又使维持抄写员的宗教团体和教会在经济上的重要性降低。</p>

            <!-- <p>Mass production of books ended the Church’s monopoly on Scripture, as well as on other forms of information. The wider availability of books reduced the cost of literacy and thus multiplied the number of thinkers who were in a position to offer their own opinions on important subjects, particularly theological subjects. As theological historian Euan Cameron put it, “a series of publishing milestones” in the first two decades of the sixteenth century set the groundwork for the application of “modern text criticism to Scriptures.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en30" id="text00010.html#ch04en30">30</a></sup>This “threatened the monopoly” of the Church “by questioning corrupt readings of texts which had been used to support traditional dogmas.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en31" id="text00010.html#ch04en31">31</a></sup>This new knowledge encouraged the emergence of competitive Protestant sects who sought to formulate their own interpretations of the Bible. Mass production of books lowered the cost of heresy and gave the heretics large audiences of readers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>书籍的大量生产结束了教会对经文以及其他形式的信息的垄断。书籍的广泛供应降低了识字的成本，从而使有能力就重要课题，特别是对神学课题提出自己意见的思想家数量成倍增加。正如神学历史学家尤安·卡梅伦（<em>Euan Cameron</em>）所说，十六世纪头 20 年的『一系列出版里程碑』为『现代文本批评在经文中的应用』奠定了基础。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en30" id="text00010.html#ch04en30">30</a></sup>这威胁到教会的垄断地位，『质疑那些被用来支持传统教条的腐败的文本解读』。书籍的大量生产降低了异端的成本，使异端有了大量的读者。</p>

            <!-- <p>Publishing also helped destroy the medieval worldview. The greater availability and lower costs for information led to shifts away from a view of the world linked by symbolism rather than causal connections. “Symbolism’s image of the world is distinguished by impeccable order, architectonic structure, hierarchic subordination. For each symbolic connexion implies a difference of rank or sanctity.… The walnut signifies Christ; the sweet kernel is His divine nature, the green and pulpy outer peel is His humanity, the wooden shell between is the cross. Thus all things raise the thoughts to the eternal.…”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en32" id="text00010.html#ch04en32">32</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>出版业也有助于摧毁中世纪的世界观。更多的信息和更低的成本导致了从由象征主义而不是因果关系联系起来的世界观的转变。『象征主义的世界形象是以无懈可击的秩序、建筑结构、等级从属关系为特征的。因为每一种象征性的联系都意味着等级或神圣性的不同…… 核桃象征着基督；甜美的内核是他的神性，绿色和多浆的外皮是他的人性，中间的木壳是十字架。因此，所有的东西都把思想提高到永恒的……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en32" id="text00010.html#ch04en32">32</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>A symbolic mode of thinking not only complemented a hierarchic structure of society; it also suited illiteracy. Ideas conveyed by symbols in woodcuts were accessible to an illiterate population. By contrast, the advent of printing in the modern period led to the development of causal connections, employing the scientific method, for a literate population.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>符号化的思维模式不仅是对社会等级结构的补充，它也适合文盲。木刻画中的符号所传达的思想可以为文盲所接受。相比之下，近代印刷术的出现导致了因果关系的发展，采用了科学的方法，为识字的人口所接受。</p>

            <h2>今天的参照物</h2>

            <!-- <p>Medieval society, seemingly so stable and secure in its beliefs in the middle of the fifteenth century, was rapidly transformed. Its predominant institution, the Church, saw its monopoly challenged and shattered. Authority that had been unquestioned for centuries was suddenly in dispute. Beliefs and loyalties more sacred than those that bind any citizen to a nation-state today were reconsidered and renounced within a few short years, all because of a technological revolution that came into its own in the last decade of the fifteenth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>We believe that change as dramatic as that of five hundred years ago will happen again. The Information Revolution will destroy the monopoly of power of the nation-state as surely as the Gunpowder Revolution destroyed the Church’s monopoly. There is a striking analogy between the situation at the end of the fifteenth century, when life had become thoroughly saturated by organized religion, and that of today, when the world has become saturated with politics. The Church then and the nation-state today are both examples of institutions grown to a senile extreme. Like the late-medieval Church, the nation-state at the end of the twentieth century is a deeply indebted institution that can no longer pay its way. Its operations are ever more irrelevant and even counterproductive to the prosperity of those who not long ago might have been its staunchest supporters.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>我们相信，像五百年前那样巨大的变化将再次发生。信息革命将摧毁领土国家的权力垄断，就像火药革命摧毁教会的垄断一样肯定。十五世纪末的情况与今天的情况有着惊人的相似之处，当时的生活已经被有组织的宗教所彻底饱和，而今天的世界已经被政治所饱和。当时的教会和今天的领土国家都是机构发展到衰老的极端的例子。和中世纪晚期的教会一样，二十世纪末的领土国家也是一个负债累累的机构，无法再支付自己的生活。它的运作与那些不久前还可能是其最坚定的支持者的繁荣越来越不相关，甚至产生了反作用。</p>

Little or no consideration was given to the rising opportunity costs of staging exaggerated religious observances. These costs fell most heavily upon the more ambitious and hardworking peasants, burghers, and yeoman farmers, who depended more than the aristocracy upon deploying their capital usefully.

            <p>例如，在一整年中，无论最近的 12 月 28 日是哪一天，都禁止做生意。因此，如果是星期二，就不能在星期二进行合法的商业活动，这是为了纪念无辜者被屠杀而必须表达的虔诚。当 12 月 28 日落在周日以外的任何一天时，这一禁令阻碍了许多类型的商业潜力，通过延迟交易或完全阻止交易来增加成本。</p>

            <h3>垄断价格</h3>

            <!-- <p>Canon law was also imposed to reinforce monopoly prices. The Church earned significant revenues from the sale of alum mined from its properties in Tolfa, Italy. When some of its customers in the textile industry showed a preference for cheaper alum imported from Turkey, the Vatican attempted to sustain its monopoly pricing through canon law, declaring it sinful to use the less costly alum. Merchants who persisted in purchasing the cheaper Turkish product were excommunicated. The famous ban on eating meat on Friday originated in the same spirit. The Church was not only the largest feudal landholder; it also held major fisheries. Church Fathers discovered a theological necessity for the pious to eat fish, which not incidentally ensured a demand for their product at a time when transport and sanitary conditions discouraged fish consumption.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>《教会法》的实施也是为了加强垄断价格。教会通过销售从其在意大利托尔法的财产中开采的明矾获得了大量收入。当纺织业的一些客户表现出对从土耳其进口的廉价明矾的偏好时，梵蒂冈试图通过教规法维持其垄断定价，宣布使用成本较低的明矾是有罪的。坚持购买便宜的土耳其产品的商人被逐出教会。著名的禁止在星期五吃肉的禁令也是源于这种精神。教会不仅是最大的封建土地所有者；它还拥有主要的渔业。教父们发现虔诚的教徒有吃鱼的神学需要，这在当时交通和卫生条件不鼓励吃鱼的情况下，不失为一种对其产品的需求。</p>

            <!-- <p>Like the nation-state today, the late-medieval Church not only regulated specific industries to directly underpin its own interests; it also made the most of its regulatory powers to gain revenue for itself in other ways. Clerics went to special pains to promulgate regulations and edicts that were difficult to abide by. For example, incest was very broadly defined, so that even remote cousins and persons related only by marriage required special dispensation from the Church to marry. As this included almost everyone in many small European villages before the era of modern travel, selling waivers for incestuous marriages became a thriving source of Church revenue. Even sex within marriage itself was tightly circumscribed by ecclesiastic regulation. Sexual relations between spouses were illegal on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, as well as for forty days prior to Easter and Christmas. Further, couples were to abstain from sex for three days prior to receiving communion. In other words, married couples were forbidden to enjoy sex without an indulgence for a minimum of 55 percent of the days of the year. In <em>The Bishop's Brothels,</em>historian E. J. Burford suggests that these “idiotic” regulations of marriage helped stimulate the growth of medieval prostitution, from which the Church profited mightily.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en35" id="text00010.html#ch04en35">35</a></sup>Burford reports that the Bishop of Winchester was for many centuries the principal of London’s Bankside brothels in Southwark. Further, ecclesiastical profiteering from prostitution was by no means merely a local English affair:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>就像今天的领土国家一样，中世纪后期的教会不仅对特定行业进行监管，以直接支持其自身的利益；它还充分利用其监管权力，以其他方式为自己获得收入。教士们不厌其烦地颁布难以遵守的法规和法令。例如，乱伦的定义非常广泛，因此，即使是远房表亲和只有婚姻关系的人也需要教会的特别许可才能结婚。由于在现代旅行时代之前，这几乎包括了许多欧洲小村庄的每个人，为乱伦婚姻出售豁免书成为教会收入的一个繁荣来源。即使是婚姻中的性行为本身也受到教会法规的严格限制。夫妻之间的性关系在周日、周三和周五，以及复活节和圣诞节前的四十天都是非法的。此外，夫妻在接受圣餐前三天要禁欲。换句话说，已婚夫妇在一年中至少有
                55% 的日子里被禁止享受性生活而不被放纵。在《主教的妓院》（The Bishop's Brothels）一书中，历史学家 E.J.Burford 提出，这些『愚蠢的』婚姻规定帮助刺激了中世纪卖淫业的发展，教会从中获得了巨大的利益。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en35" id="text00010.html#ch04en35">35</a></sup>Burford 称，在许多世纪里，温彻斯特主教是伦敦南华克的班克斯特妓院的负责人。</p>

            <!-- <p>The power to regulate arbitrarily is also the power to sell an exemption from the harm such regulations can do. The Church sold permits, or “indulgences,” authorizing everything from relief from petty burdens on commerce to permission to eat dairy products in Lent. These “indulgences” were not only sold at high prices to the aristocracy and the rich burghers. They were also packaged as lottery prizes much like the government-run lotteries of today to attract the pennies of the poor.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en39" id="text00010.html#ch04en39">39</a></sup>The trade in indulgences increased as the Church’s expenditures outran its income. This led many to infer the obvious, that the institutional Church was using its powers primarily to raise revenues. As a contemporary critic put it, “Canon law was instituted solely for the purpose of making a great deal of money; whoever would be a Christian has to buy his way out of its provisions.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en40" id="text00010.html#ch04en40">40</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

Often the fines were imposed for some petty offense done by a few persons who need not even have been members of the congregation in question. For example, in 1436, Bishop Jacques Du Chatelier, “a very ostentatious, grasping man,” closed the Church of the Innocents in Paris for twenty-two days, halting all religious services while waiting for an impossibly large fine to be paid by two beggars. The men had quarreled in the church and shed a few drops of blood, which the bishop claimed had deconsecrated the church.

            <h2>HYPOCRISY</h2>

            <!-- <p>Beneath a “superficial crust of piety,” late-medieval society was remarkably blasphemous, irreverent, and debauched. Churches were the favorite trysting places of young men and women, and frequent gathering spots of prostitutes and vendors of obscene pictures. Historians report that “the irreverence of daily religious practice was almost unbounded.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en51" id="text00010.html#ch04en51">51</a></sup>Choristers hired to chant for the souls of the dead commonly substituted profane words in the mass. Vigils and processions, which played a far bigger role in medieval religious practice than they do today, were nonetheless “disgraced by ribaldry, mockery and drinking.” So said late-medieval Europe’s leading theological authority, Denis the Carthusian.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en52" id="text00010.html#ch04en52">52</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在『表面的虔诚』之下，中世纪后期的社会是非常亵渎、不敬和放荡的。教堂是年轻男女最喜欢的约会场所，也是妓女和淫秽画商经常聚集的地方。历史学家报告说，『日常宗教活动的不敬几乎是无止境的。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en51" id="text00010.html#ch04en51">51</a></sup>受雇为死者的灵魂诵经的唱诗员通常在弥撒中用亵渎的词语代替。守夜和游行在中世纪的宗教实践中发挥了比今天大得多的作用，但还是被『粗俗、嘲弄和饮酒所玷污』。中世纪晚期欧洲的主要神学权威，卡尔图斯人丹尼斯如是说。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en52" id="text00010.html#ch04en52">52 </a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>While such a report could be challenged as the griping of a stiff-lipped moralist, it is merely one of many accounts that paint the same picture. There is ample reason to believe that the bawdy and the sacred were frequently close companions in medieval life. Pilgrimages, for example, so often degenerated into riot and debauchery that high-minded reformers argued without success that they be suppressed. Local religious processions also provided regular occasions for mobs to vandalize, loot, and generally indulge in whatever drunken antics caught their fancy. Even when people sat still to hear mass, it was frequently not a sober experience. Prodigious quantities of wine were consumed in church, especially on festival nights. Accounts from the Council of Strasbourg show that those who “watched in prayer” on St. Adolphus Night drank 1,100 liters of wine provided by the council in honor of the saint.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>虽然这样的报告可以被质疑为僵硬的道德家的抱怨，但它只是描述相同情况的许多说法之一。我们有充分的理由相信，在中世纪的生活中，放荡不羁的行为和神圣的事物经常是亲密无间的伙伴。例如，朝圣活动经常沦为骚乱和放荡，以至于思想高尚的改革者争辩说要禁止这种活动，但没有成功。当地的宗教游行也为暴民提供了经常性的机会，使他们能够破坏、抢劫，并普遍沉溺于任何引起他们兴趣的醉酒闹剧。即使人们静静地坐在那里听弥撒，也常常不是一种清醒的体验。在教堂里，特别是在节日的夜晚，人们喝了大量的酒。斯特拉斯堡议会的记录显示，在圣阿道夫之夜，那些『在祈祷中守望』的人喝下了议会为纪念圣人而提供的
                1100 升葡萄酒。</p>

            <!-- <p>Jean Gerson, a leading fifteenth-century theologian, reports that “the most sacred festivals, even Christmas night,” were spent “in debauchery, playing at cards, swearing and blaspheming.” When admonished for these lapses, the common people “plead the example of the nobility and the clergy, who behave in like manner with impunity.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en53" id="text00010.html#ch04en53">53</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>十五世纪著名的神学家简·格森（<em>Jean Gerson</em>）报告说，『最神圣的节日，甚至是圣诞之夜，都是在放荡不羁、打牌、发誓和亵渎中度过的。当人们为这些失误受到告诫时，老百姓以贵族和神职人员为榜样，他们以同样的方式行事而不受惩罚。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en53" id="text00010.html#ch04en53">53</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The piety that rationalized the saturation of society by organized religion in the late Middle Ages served the same purpose as the “compassion” that is meant to justify the political domination of life today. The sale of indulgences to satisfy a desire for piety without morals parallels lavish welfare spending to slake the pretense of compassion without charity. It was largely immaterial whether the actual effect of received practices was to improve moral character or save souls, just as it is largely immaterial whether a welfare program actually improves the lives of the people to whom it is directed. “Piety,” like “compassion,” was an almost superstitious invocation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在中世纪晚期，有组织的宗教使社会的饱和度合理化的虔诚，与今天旨在为政治统治生活辩护的『同情心』的目的相同。出售赎罪券以满足人们对没有道德的虔诚的渴望，这与奢侈的福利支出以满足没有慈善的同情心的幌子是一样的。接受的做法的实际效果是否提高了道德品质或拯救了灵魂，这在很大程度上是不重要的，正如一个福利项目是否真正改善了它所针对的人的生活一样。『虔诚』，就像『同情』一样，几乎是一种迷信式的召唤。</p>

            <!-- <p>In a time when causal relationships were scarcely understood, rituals and sacraments of the Church permeated every phase of life. “… A journey, a task, a visit, were equally attended by a thousand formalities: benedictions, ceremonies, formulas.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en54" id="text00010.html#ch04en54">54</a></sup>Prayers inscribed on pieces of parchment were strung like necklaces on those suffering from fevers.

            <!-- <p>People were so firmly convinced of the miraculous qualities attaching to the relics of saints that the death of any notably pious person frequently occasioned a mad rush to divide up the body. After Thomas Aquinas died in the monastery of Fossanuova, the monks there decapitated and boiled his body in order to secure control of his bones. When St. Elizabeth of Hungary was lying in state, “a crowd of worshippers came and cut or tore strips of the linen enveloping her face; they cut off the hair, the nails, even the nipples.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en57" id="text00010.html#ch04en57">57</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

More emphatically than in the modern period, people in the Middle Ages believed that demons were real, that God actively intervened in the world, and that prayer, penance, and pilgrimages earned divine favor.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>To say simply that people believed in God could convey neither the intensity of their adherence nor the apparent ease with which medieval piety seemed to bed down with sin. Belief in the efficacy of rites, rituals, and sacraments was so pervasive that it perhaps inevitably undercut the urgency of behaving in a virtuous way. For any sin or spiritual defect there was a remedy, a penance that would clear the slate, in what came to be a “mathematics of salvation.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en58" id="text00010.html#ch04en58">58</a></sup>Religion became so all-pervasive that its sincerity necessarily began to flag. As Huizinga put it, “Religion penetrating all relations in life means a constant blending of the spheres of holy and of profane thought. Holy things will become too common to be deeply felt.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en59" id="text00010.html#ch04en59">59</a></sup>And so it was.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>简单地说，人们相信上帝，既不能表达他们的信仰强度，也不能表达中世纪的虔诚似乎与罪恶同归于尽的明显轻松。对礼节、仪式和圣事的功效的信仰是如此普遍，以至于它也许不可避免地削弱了以良性方式行事的紧迫性。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en58" id="text00010.html#ch04en58">58</a></sup>宗教变得如此普遍，其真诚度必然开始下降。正如 Huizinga 所说：『宗教渗透到生活中的所有关系，意味着神圣和非神圣思想领域的不断融合。圣洁的东西会变得太普通，以至于无法被深刻地感受到。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en59" id="text00010.html#ch04en59">59</a></sup>就是这样。</p>

            <!-- <h2>DOWNSIZING THE CHURCH</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h2>教会规模的缩小</h2>

            <!-- <p>By the end of the fifteenth century, the Church was not only as corrupt as the nation-state today; it was also a major drag on economic growth. The Church engrossed large amounts of capital in unproductive ways, imposing burdens that limited the output of society and suppressed commerce. These burdens, like those imposed by the nation-state today, were numerous. We know what happened to organized religion in the wake of the Gunpowder Revolution: it created strong incentives to downsize religious institutions and lower their costs. When the traditional Church declined to do this, Protestant sects seized the opportunity to compete. In so doing they employed almost every device imaginable to reduce the cost of living a-pious life:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>到十五世纪末，教会不仅像今天的领土国家一样腐败，而且也是经济增长的主要阻力。教会以非生产性的方式吸纳了大量的资本，施加了限制社会产出和压制商业的负担。这些负担，就像今天的领土国家所强加的那些负担一样，是很多的。我们知道在火药革命之后，有组织的宗教发生了什么：它创造了强烈的动机来缩小宗教机构并降低其成本。当传统教会拒绝这样做时，新教教派抓住了竞争的机会。在此过程中，他们采用了几乎所有可以想象到的手段来降低虔诚生活的成本：</p>

            <!-- <ul><span class="english"></span> -->
            <ul>

                <!-- <li>They built spare new churches and sometimes stripped the altars of older ones to free capital for other uses.</li><span class="english"></span> -->
                <li>他们建造空闲的新教堂，有时还拆除旧教堂的祭坛，以腾出资金用于其他用途。</li>

                <li>他们以降低成本的方式修订基督教教义，强调信仰而非善行是得救的关键。</li>

                <li>他们制定了新的、简洁的礼仪，缩减或取消了节庆日，并废除了许多圣礼。</li>

                <!-- <li>They closed monasteries and nunneries, and stopped giving alms to mendicant orders. Poverty went from being an apostolic virtue to an unwelcome and often blameworthy social problem.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en60" id="text00010.html#ch04en60">60</a></sup></li><span class="english"></span> -->

                    <!-- </ul><span class="english"></span> -->
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>To understand how downsizing the Church liberated productivity, you have to review the many ways that the Church stood in the way of growth before its monopoly was broken. Much as the nation-state does today, the Church at the end of the fifteenth century imposed an incredible burden of excess costs.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>要理解缩小教会规模是如何解放生产力的，你必须回顾教会在其垄断被打破之前阻碍增长的许多方式。就像今天的领土国家一样，教会在十五世纪末强加了一个令人难以置信的超额成本负担。</p>

            <!-- <p>1. Direct costs such as tithes, taxes, and fees fed the overgrown ecclesiastical bureaucracy. Tithes were common to Protestant churches that replaced the medieval “Holy Mother Church” also, but they tended not to be collectible in urban areas. In effect, the end of the Church’s monopoly led to declining marginal tax rates in regions with the most highly developed commerce.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1. 直接成本，如什一税、税金和费用，养活了过度膨胀的教会官僚机构。什一税在取代中世纪『圣母教会』的新教教堂中也很常见，但在城市地区往往无法收取。实际上，教会垄断的结束导致商业最发达地区的边际税率不断下降。</p>

            <!-- <p>2. Religious doctrines made saving difficult. The arch-villain of the medieval Church was the “miser,” the person who saved his gold at the risk of his soul. The requirement for the faithful to fund “good deeds” entailed costly contributions to the Church. The doctrine of “satisfactions” obliged those concerned about salvation to endow masses or “chantries” in order to avoid purgatory. Luther attacked this directly in the eighth and thirteenth of his ninety-five theses. He wrote that “the dying will pay all their debts by their death.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en61" id="text00010.html#ch04en61">61</a></sup>In other words, the capital of the Protestant believer was available to pass on to his heirs. Under Protestant doctrine, there was no need to endow chantries to repeat masses, usually for thirty years, and sometimes, for the very wealthy, in perpetuity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>2. 宗教教义使储蓄变得困难。中世纪教会的大坏蛋是『守财奴』，即以灵魂为代价保存黄金的人。要求信徒为『善行』提供资金，需要向教会提供昂贵的捐款。『满足』的教义迫使那些关心救赎的人捐赠弥撒或『圣堂』，以避免炼狱。路德在他的九十五条论纲中的第八条和第十三条直接攻击了这一点。他写道：『垂死的人将通过他们的死亡偿还所有的债务。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en61" id="text00010.html#ch04en61">61</a></sup>换言之，新教信徒的资本可以传给他的继承人。在新教教义下，没有必要捐赠圣堂来重复做弥撒，通常是三十年，有时对非常富有的人来说，是永久的。</p>

            <!-- <p>3. The ideology of the medieval Church also encouraged diversion of capital into acquisition of relics. Numerous relic cults were endowed with large sums to acquire physical objects associated with Christ or various saints. The very wealthy even assembled personal collections of relics. For example, the Elector Frederick of Saxony amassed a collection of nineteen thousand relics, some acquired on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1493. His collection included what he believed to be “the body of a holy innocent, Mary’s milk, and straw from the stable of the Nativity.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en62" id="text00010.html#ch04en62">62</a></sup>Presumably, the return on capital invested in these relics was low. The shift to an emphasis on faith and the notion of the elect downgraded the importance of acquisition of the trappings of Christian life for use as charms and encouraged money to find more productive channels that paid a return that the monarch could tap.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>3. 中世纪教会的意识形态也鼓励将资本转用于购买圣物。众多的圣物崇拜被赋予了大量的资金，以获得与基督或各种圣人有关的实物。非常富有的人甚至收集了个人的圣物收藏。例如，萨克森的选帝侯弗雷德里克积累了一万九千件圣物，其中一些是在 1493 年去耶路撒冷朝圣时获得的。他的收藏包括他认为是『一个神圣的无辜者的身体、玛丽亚的乳汁和来自耶稣诞生地马厩的稻草。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en62" id="text00010.html#ch04en62">62</a></sup>据推测，投资于这些遗物的资本回报很低。向强调信仰和选民概念的转变，降低了获得基督教生活的装饰品作为魅力的重要性，并鼓励资金寻找更有成效的渠道，以获得君主可以利用的回报。</p>

            <!-- <p>4. The advent of Protestant denominations broke the medieval Church’s economic monopolies, and led to a significant weakening of regulation. As we have seen, canon law was frequently bent to support Church monopolies and commercial interests. Because the new denominations had fewer economic interests to protect and promote, their version of religious doctrine tended to result in a freer system, with fewer inhibitions of commerce.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>4. 新教教派的出现打破了中世纪教会的经济垄断，并导致了监管的大幅削弱。正如我们所看到的，教规法经常被扭曲以支持教会的垄断和商业利益。由于新的教派需要保护和促进的经济利益较少，他们的宗教教义的版本倾向于形成一个更自由的系统，对商业的抑制较少。</p>

            <!-- <p>5. The Protestant revolution abolished many of the rites and rituals of the medieval Church that burdened the time of the faithful. Rites, sacraments, and holy days had been elaborated to absorb almost the entire calendar by the late fifteenth century. This ceremonial overload was a logical outgrowth of the Church’s insistence “that one could multiply acts of prayer or worship as often as one liked and gain benefits from them.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en63" id="text00010.html#ch04en63">63</a></sup>Multiply they did. Productivity was taxed by longer and more elaborate services, obligations to recite repetitious prayers in penance, and the proliferation of feast days of saints during which no work could be done. Numerous regulations and ceremonies punctuated the day and the seasons, considerably shrinking the time available for productive tasks. This may have done little to interrupt the rhythms of medieval farming, in which 90 percent or more of the population was engaged. There were many periods during the seasons when field labor was not required on a daily basis. The yield of crops under medieval conditions probably varied more with the weather and uncontrollable rhythms of infestation than from any marginal addition of labor beyond the minimum that the Church calendar accommodated.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>5. 新教革命废除了中世纪教会的许多仪式和典礼，这些仪式和典礼给信徒们的时间带来了负担。仪式、圣礼和圣日已经被精心设计，到十五世纪末几乎占据了整个日历。这种超负荷的仪式是教会坚持『一个人可以随心所欲地增加祈祷或崇拜的次数，并从中获得好处』的逻辑结果。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en63" id="text00010.html#ch04en63">63</a></sup>他们确实增加了。生产力因更长、更复杂的服务、在忏悔中背诵重复的祈祷词的义务，以及不能工作的圣人节日的增加而受到影响。众多的规章制度和仪式在一天和一个季节中穿插进行，大大减少了可用于生产任务的时间。这可能对中断中世纪农业的节奏没有什么作用，因为
                90% 或更多的人都在从事农业生产。在四季中，有许多时期不需要每天进行田间劳动。在中世纪的条件下，农作物的产量可能更多的是随着天气和不可控制的虫害节奏而变化，而不是因为教会日历所容纳的最低限度的劳动之外的任何边际增加。</p>

            <!-- <p>The larger problem of lost productivity did not fall so much in farming as in other areas. The Church’s demands on time were far less compatible with craft work, manufacturing, transport, commerce, or any other undertaking where productivity and profitability were likely to be crucially determined by the amount of time devoted to the task.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>更大的生产力损失问题并没有像其他领域那样发生在农业上。教会对时间的要求与手工业、制造业、运输业、商业或其他任何可能由用于任务的时间量来决定生产力和利润的事业远不相容。</p>

            <!-- <p>It may not be a coincidence that the great transition at the end of the fifteenth century occurred at a time when land rents were rising and real wages for the peasantry were in decline. Increased population pressures had reduced the yield from the common lands, often found surrounding rivers and streams, upon which peasants depended to graze their livestock, and in some cases, for fish and firewood. The whittling down of living standards placed increasingly urgent pressures on peasants to find alternative sources of income. As a result, “more and more of the rural population turned to small-scale manufacturing for the market, above all in textiles, in the process known as ‘putting-out’ or ‘proto-industrialization.’ ”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en64" id="text00010.html#ch04en64">64</a></sup>The ceremonial burdens on time imposed by the Church stood in the way of efforts by the more ambitious peasants to supplement their farming income by craft work, as indeed they inhibited any redeployment of effort in new economic directions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>十五世纪末的大转型发生在土地租金上涨和农民实际工资下降的时候，这可能不是一个巧合。人口压力的增加减少了公共土地的产量，这些土地通常在河流和溪流周围，农民依靠这些土地放牧，在某些情况下，也依靠这些土地捕鱼和烧柴。生活水平的下降给农民带来了越来越紧迫的压力，他们需要寻找其他收入来源。因此，『越来越多的农村人口转向小规模的市场制造，首先是纺织业，这个过程被称为「淘汰」或「原工业化」。 』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en64" id="text00010.html#ch04en64">64</a></sup>教会强加的仪式性负担阻碍了更有雄心的农民通过手工艺工作补充其农业收入的努力，因为它们确实抑制了在新经济方向上的任何重新部署。</p>

            <!-- <p>One of the more pronounced contributions that Protestant sects made to productivity was the scrapping of forty feast days. This not only saved the considerable costs of staging the festivals, including outfitting the village tables with food and drink; it also freed a great deal of valuable time. Implicitly, everyone who stopped honoring the forty banished feast days could add three hundred man-hours or more to his annual productivity. In short, the scrapping of ceremonial overload in the medieval Church opened the way for an appreciable increase in output simply by freeing time that would otherwise have been lost to commerce.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>新教教派对生产力做出的一个更明显的贡献是取消了四十个节庆日。这不仅节省了举办节日的大量费用，包括为村里的餐桌配备食物和饮料；还释放了大量的宝贵时间。隐含的意思是，每一个停止尊重四十个被禁止的节日的人可以在他的年度生产力中增加三百个工时或更多。简而言之，中世纪教会废除了过多的仪式，仅仅是通过释放本来会被用于商业的时间，就为明显增加产出开辟了道路。</p>

            <!-- <p>6. The break in the Church’s monopoly disgorged vast amounts of assets that were yielding low returns under Church management—a situation with obvious parallels to state holdings late in the twentieth century. The Church was the largest feudal landholder by far. Its grip on the land matched that of the state in highly politicized societies today—exceeding 50 percent of the total in some European countries such as Bohemia. According to canon law, once a property came under the control of the Church, it could not be alienated. Thus the holdings of Church land tended steadily to rise, as the Church received more and more testamentary gifts from the faithful for financing various social welfare services, chantries, and other activities.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>6. 教会的垄断地位被打破后，大量的资产在教会的管理下产生了低回报 —— 这种情况与二十世纪末的国有资产有明显的相似之处。到目前为止，教会是最大的封建土地所有者。在当今高度政治化的社会中，教会对土地的控制力与国家不相上下 —— 在一些欧洲国家，如波西米亚，超过了土地总量的 50%。根据教规法，一旦财产被教会控制，就不能转让。因此，随着教会从信徒那里收到越来越多的遗赠品，用于资助各种社会福利服务、圣堂和其他活动，教会的土地持有量趋于稳步上升。</p>

            <!-- <p>While it is difficult to measure precisely the relative productivity of Church holdings, it must have been far lower at the end of the Middle Ages than it was in the early part of that epoch. By the fourteenth century, increased emphasis upon production for the market rather than subsistence farming had led most lay lords to turn from illiterate headmen to professional managers to optimize the output of their holdings. Their incentives probably led them to quickly outstrip the output of Church properties, which in theory usually did not accrue to anyone’s private profit. No doubt some of the more worldly prince-bishops husbanded their estates in ways indistinguishable from those of the lay lords. Yet the productivity of other Church properties would surely have suffered from failures of indifferent management by a huge, far-flung institution, whose drawbacks would have been similar to the drawbacks of state and communal ownership today. It is obvious, as well, that the seizure of the monasteries rearrayed resources that were no longer needed for the reproduction of books and manuscripts after the advent of the printing press.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管很难精确地衡量教会财产的相对生产力，但在中世纪末，它肯定比该时代的早期要低得多。到了十四世纪，对市场生产而不是自给自足的农业的日益重视，使大多数非专业的领主从文盲头目变成了职业经理人，以优化他们的土地产出。他们的激励措施可能导致他们迅速超过了教会财产的产出，理论上，这些财产通常不会为任何人带来私利。毫无疑问，一些比较世俗的王子主教以与普通领主无异的方式管理他们的财产。然而，其他教会财产的生产力肯定会受到一个巨大的、分散的机构的冷漠管理的影响，其弊端与今天国家和社区所有权的弊端相似。同样明显的是，对修道院的查封重新安排了资源，而这些资源在印刷术出现后不再需要用于复制书籍和手稿。</p>

            <!-- <p>7. As we detailed in <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>some of the Protestant sects immediately responded to the Gunpowder Revolution by altering their doctrines in ways that encouraged commerce, such as by lifting the injunction against usury, or lending at interest. The ideological opposition of the medieval Church to capitalism was a drag on growth. The main ideological thrust of Church teachings was to reinforce feudalism, in which the Church had a large stake, as the largest feudal landholder. Consciously, or not, the Church tended to make religious virtues of its own economic interests, while militating against the development of manufacturing and independent commercial wealth that were destined to destabilize the feudal system. Injunctions against “avarice,” for example, applied mainly to commercial transactions rather than feudal levies, and never to the sale of indulgences. The infamous attempts by the Church to fix a “just price” for items in commerce tended to suppress economic returns on those products and services where the Church itself was not a producer.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>7. 正如我们在《大清算》中所详述的，一些新教教派立即对火药革命做出反应，以鼓励商业的方式改变他们的教义，例如取消禁止高利贷的禁令，或借出利息。中世纪教会在意识形态上对资本主义的反对是对增长的拖累。教会教义的主要意识形态主旨是加强封建主义，而教会作为最大的封建土地所有者，在其中有很大的利益。无论是否自觉，教会都倾向于把自己的经济利益作为宗教美德，同时反对制造业和独立商业财富的发展，因为这注定会破坏封建制度的稳定。例如，反对『贪婪』的禁令主要适用于商业交易，而不是封建征收，而且从未适用于出售赎罪券。教会为商业项目确定『合理价格』的尝试臭名昭著，这往往会抑制那些教会本身不是生产商的产品和服务的经济回报。</p>

            <!-- <p>The ban on “usury” was a signal example of the Church’s resistance to commercial innovation. Banking and credit were crucial to the development of larger-scale commercial enterprises. By restricting the availability of credit, the Church retarded growth.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>对『高利贷』的禁令是教会抵制商业创新的一个明显例子。银行和信贷是发展大规模商业企业的关键。通过限制信贷的供应，教会阻碍了增长。</p>

            <!-- <p>8. More subtly, the new denominations’ focus upon the Bible as a text helped demolish the medieval Church’s mode of thought as well as its ideology. Both placed obstacles in the way of growth. The cultural programming of the late Middle Ages encouraged people to see the world in terms of symbolic similitude rather than cause and effect. This short-circuited reasoning. It also pointed away from a mercantile conception of life. Thinking in terms of symbolic equivalences does not easily translate into thinking in terms of market values. “The three estates represent the qualities of the Virgin. The seven electors of the Empire signify the virtues; the five towns of Artois and Hainault, which in 1477 remained faithful to the house of Burgundy, are the five wise virgins.… In the same way shoes mean care and diligence, stockings perseverance, the garter resolution, etc.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en65" id="text00010.html#ch04en65">65</a></sup>As this example quoted from the distinguished medieval historian Johan Huizinga suggests, thinking was dominated by dogma, rigid symbols, and allegory that tied together every aspect of life in terms of hierarchic subordination. Every occupation, every part, every color, every number, even every element of grammar was tied into a grand system of religious conceptions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>8. 更微妙的是，新教派对作为文本的《圣经》的关注有助于摧毁中世纪教会的思维模式及其意识形态。两者都在成长的道路上设置了障碍。中世纪晚期的文化教条鼓励人们用象征性的模拟而不是因果关系来看待世界。这导致了推理的短路。它也指向了对生活的重商主义概念。用象征性的等价物来思考，不容易转化为用市场价值来思考。『三个庄园代表圣女的品质。帝国的七个选举人象征着美德；1477 年仍然忠于勃艮第家族的阿图瓦和海诺的五个城镇是五个聪明的处女…… 同样，鞋子意味着关心和勤奋，丝袜意味着坚韧不拔，吊袜带意味着决心，等等。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en65" id="text00010.html#ch04en65">65</a></sup>正如这个引自杰出的中世纪历史学家约翰·惠津加（<em>Johan Huizinga</em>）的例子所表明的那样，思维被教条、僵化的符号和寓言所支配，它们将生活的各个方面按等级隶属关系捆绑在一起。每一种职业、每一个部分、每一种颜色、每一个数字，甚至每一个语法元素都与一个宏大的宗教概念系统联系在一起。</p>

            <!-- <p>Thus the mundane bits and pieces of life were interpreted not in terms of their causal connections, but in terms of static symbols and allegories. Sometimes personifying virtues and vices, each thing stood for something, which stood for something else again, in ways that often blocked rather than clarified cause and effect To confuse matters further, relationships were often arbitrarily bound together in systems of numbers. Sevens played a particularly important role. There were the seven virtues, the seven deadly sins, the seven supplications of the Lord’s Prayer, the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven moments of the passion, the seven beatitudes, and the seven sacraments, “represented by the seven animals and followed by the seven diseases.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en66" id="text00010.html#ch04en66">66</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，生活中平凡的点点滴滴不是以其因果关系来解释，而是以静态的符号和寓言来解释。有时将美德和恶习人格化，每样东西都代表着某种东西，而这种东西又代表着另一种东西，其方式往往阻碍而不是澄清因果关系。为了进一步混淆视听，各种关系往往被任意地用数字系统捆绑在一起。七位数起着特别重要的作用。有七种美德、七宗罪、主祷文的七种祈求、圣灵的七种恩赐、激情的七种时刻、七种节庆和七种圣事，『由七种动物代表，后面是七种疾病。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en66" id="text00010.html#ch04en66">66</a></sup></p>

For this very reason, they were ill-suited to the needs of industrial society, just as the moral, cultural, and legal constraints of the modern nation-state are ill-suited to facilitating commerce in the Information Age.

People had minded less giving their money to the Church when there was no other outlet for it.

            <!-- <p>Many merchants and other commoners soon became far richer than their forebears had been under feudalism. The sharp acceleration of living standards among the merchants and small manufacturers of the early-modern period was widely unpopular among those whose incomes and way of life were collapsing with feudalism. The weakening of the Church’s monopoly and the increased megapolitical power of the rich led to a sharp reduction in income redistribution. The peasants and urban poor who were not immediate beneficiaries of the new system were bitterly envious of those who were. Huizinga described the prevailing attitude, in what could well be an important parallel with the Information Revolution: “Hatred of rich people, especially of the new rich, who were then very numerous, is general.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch04-en68" id="text00010.html#ch04en68">68</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

The breakdown of the old order almost always unleashes a surge in crime, if not the outright anarchy of the feudal revolution we explored in the last chapter.

Fledgling entrepreneurs among the crowd picked up pieces of the wall that were later marketed to capitalists far and wide as souvenir paperweights. A brisk business in these relics was done for years thereafter. Even as we write, one can still encounter occasional ads in small magazines offering bits of old East German concrete for sale at prices ordinarily commanded by high-grade silver ore. We believe that those who bought the Berlin Wall paperweights should be in no rush to sell. They hold mementos of something bigger than the collapse of Communism. We believe that the Berlin Wall became the most important pile of historical rubble since the walls of San Giovanni were blasted to smithereens almost five centuries earlier in February 1495.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en2" id="text00011.html#ch05en2">2</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1989 年 11 月 9 日和 10 日，电视向全世界播放了兴高采烈的东柏林人用大锤子拆除柏林墙的场景。人群中初出茅庐的冒险者们捡起了墙的碎片，这些碎片后来被作为纪念品的镇纸卖给了世界各地的资本家。此后多年来，这些遗物的生意非常火爆。即使在我们写作的时候，人们仍然可以在小杂志上偶尔看到广告，以高等级银矿的价格出售旧东德的混凝土碎片。我们认为，那些购买柏林墙纸杯的人不应该急于出售。他们持有的纪念品比共产主义的崩溃更重要。我们相信，自 1495 年 2 月圣乔瓦尼的城墙被炸成碎片以来，柏林墙成为最重要的一堆历史废墟。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en2" id="text00011.html#ch05en2">2</a></sup></p>

It marked the end of the feudal phase of history and the advent of industrialism, as we outlined earlier. The destruction of the Berlin Wall marks another historical watershed, the passage between the Industrial Age and the new Information Age. Never has there been so great a symbolic triumph of efficiency over power. When the walls of San Giovanni fell, it was a stark demonstration that the economic returns to violence in the world had risen sharply. The fall of the Berlin Wall says something different, namely that returns to violence are now falling. This is something that few have even begun to recognize, but it will have dramatic consequences.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

The Berlin Wall was built to a very different purpose than the walls of San Giovanni—to prevent people on the inside from escaping rather than to prevent predators on the outside from entering. That fact alone is a telling indicator of the rise in the power of the state from the fifteenth to the twentieth centuries. And in more ways than one.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

For the generations that came of age before World War II, or early in the Cold War, moving across borders is traumatic. But for new generations, who draw their bearings from a more global perspective, abandoning the country of their birth is not the unthinkable decision it would be for older persons who are more deeply inculcated with the ideology of the nation-state. Jim Taylor and Watts Wacker report the intriguing results of a mass survey of 25,000 middle-class high school students on five continents. In a sampling conducted during the 1995-96 school year by Brainwaves Group, a New York consumer-research firm, nine of ten students agreed that “it’s up to me to get what I want of life.” More strikingly, “almost half the teens said they expected to leave the country of their birth in pursuit of their goals.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en4" id="text00011.html#ch05en4">4</a></sup>Perhaps because he is tuned in to the attitudes of the MTV generation, as the first presidential candidate to campaign on MTV, Bill Clinton has sought to make it more difficult for Americans to “leave the country of their birth in pursuit of their goals.” In 1995, at about the same time that the high school students were declaring their intentions to seek independence, the President of the United States proposed the enactment of an exit tax, a “Berlin Wall for Capital,” that would require wealthy Americans to pay a substantial ransom to escape with even part of their money.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <p>克林顿的赎金不仅让人联想到东德后期将公民视为资产的政策；它还让人想起罗马帝国在衰落中为支撑其财政状况而采取的越来越严厉的措施。这段来自《剑桥古代史》的文字讲述了这个故事。</p>

            <!-- <blockquote><span class="english"></span> -->
            <blockquote>

                <!-- <p>Thus began the fierce endeavor of the State to squeeze the population to the last drop. Since economic resources fell short of what was needed, the strong fought to secure the chief share for themselves with a violence and unscrupulousness well in keeping with the origin of those in power and with a soldiery accustomed to plunder. The full rigour of the law was let loose on the population. Soldiers acted as bailiffs or wandered as secret police through the land. Those who suffered most were, of course, the propertied class. It was relatively easy to lay hands on their property, and in an emergency, they were the class from whom something could be extorted most frequently and quickly.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en5" id="text00011.html#ch05en5">5</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>由此，国家开始了激烈的努力，将人口压榨到最后一滴。由于经济资源不能满足需要，强者们以暴力和不择手段的方式为自己争取主要份额，这与当权者的出身和习惯于掠夺的士兵是一致的。法律的严厉性在民众中得到了充分的发挥。 士兵们充当法警，或作为秘密警察在土地上游荡。当然，受影响最大的是有产阶级。对他们的财产下手相对容易，而且在紧急情况下，他们是可以最经常、最迅速地被勒索的阶层。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en5" id="text00011.html#ch05en5">5</a></sup></p>

                <!-- </blockquote><span class="english"></span> -->
            </blockquote>

            <!-- <p>When failing systems have the power to do so, they often impose penal burdens upon those seeking to escape. Again, we quote <em>The Cambridge Ancient History:</em>“If the propertied class buried their money, or sacrificed two-thirds of their estate to escape from a magistracy, or went so far as to give up their whole property in order to get free of the domains rent, and the non-propertied class ran away, the State replied by increasing the pressure.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当失败的系统有能力这样做时，它们往往会对那些寻求逃脱的人施加刑事负担。我们再次引用《剑桥古代史》：『如果有产阶级把钱埋起来，或者牺牲三分之二的财产来逃避地方官，或者为了摆脱领域租金而不惜放弃全部财产，而非有产阶级则逃跑，那么国家的回答就是增加压力。』 </p>
            <p>这一点值得我们记住。</p>

            <!-- <p>This is worth remembering as you plan ahead. The twilight of state systems in the past has seldom been a polite, orderly process. We mentioned the nasty habits of Roman tax collectors in Chapter 2. The large numbers of <em>agri deserti,</em>or abandoned farms, in Western Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire reflected only a small part of a wider problem. In fact, exactions tended to be relatively mild in Gaul, and in the frontier areas that comprise current-day Luxembourg and Germany. In Rome’s most fertile region, Egypt, where farming was more productive because of irrigation, desertion by owners was an even bigger problem. The question of whether to attempt escape, the <em>ultimum refugium,</em>as it was known in Latin, became the overriding quandary of almost everyone with property. Records show that “among the common questions which used to be put to an oracle in Egypt three standard types were: ‘Am I to become a beggar?’ ‘Shall I take to flight?’ and ‘Is my flight to be stopped?’ ”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en6" id="text00011.html#ch05en6">6</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这一点值得你在未雨绸缪时记住。过去的国家制度的黄昏很少是一个有礼貌、有秩序的过程。我们在第二章中提到了罗马征税人的讨厌的习惯。罗马帝国崩溃后，西欧大量的被遗弃的田地，只反映了一个更广泛问题的一小部分。事实上，在高卢以及包括今天的卢森堡和德国在内的边境地区，征税往往相对温和。在罗马最肥沃的地区 —— 埃及，由于有灌溉设施，那里的农业产量更高，主人的遗弃是一个更大的问题。是否尝试逃跑的问题，即，拉丁语中所说的『终极避难所』（<em>ultimum refugium</em>），几乎成了所有拥有财产的人的首要难题。记录显示，『在埃及，曾经向神谕提出的常见问题中有三种标准类型。「我将成为一个乞丐吗？」、「我应该逃跑吗？」和「我的逃跑会被阻止吗？」 』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en6" id="text00011.html#ch05en6">6</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Clinton’s proposal says yes. It is an early version of an obstacle to escape that is likely to grow more onerous as the fiscal resources of the nation-state slip away. Of course, the first U.S. version of an exit barrier is more benign than Erich Honecker’s concrete and barbed wire. It also involves greater price sensitivity, with the burden falling only on “billionaires” with taxable estates above $600,000. Nonetheless, it was justified with similar arguments to those once propounded by Honecker in defense of the late German Democratic Republic’s most famous public works project. Honecker claimed that the East German state had a substantial investment in would-be refugees. He pointed out that allowing them to leave freely would create an economic disadvantage for the state, which required their efforts in East Germany.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>克林顿的提案说，是。这是一个早期版本的逃亡障碍，随着领土国家的财政资源的滑落，这个障碍可能会变得更加繁重。当然，美国第一个版本的出境障碍比埃里希·昂纳克的混凝土和有刺铁丝网更加良性。它还涉及到更大的价格敏感性，负担只落在应税财产超过 60 万美元的『亿万富翁』身上。尽管如此，它的理由与昂纳克曾经为已故德意志民主共和国最著名的公共工程项目辩护时提出的论点相似。昂纳克声称，『东德国家对未来的难民有大量投资。他指出，允许他们自由离开会给国家带来经济上的不利，国家需要他们在东德做出努力。』</p>

            <!-- <p>If you accept the premise that people are or ought to be assets of the state, Honecker’s wall made sense. Berlin without a wall was a loophole to the Communists, just as escape from U.S. tax jurisdiction was a loophole to Clinton’s IRS. Clinton’s arguments about escaping billionaires, aside from showing a politician’s usual disregard for the integrity of numbers, were similar in kind to Honecker’s, but somewhat less logical because the U.S. government, in fact, does not have a large economic investment in wealthy citizens who might seek to lee. It is not a question of their having been educated at state expense and wanting to slip away and practice law somewhere else. The overwhelming majority of those to whom the exit tax would apply have created their wealth by their own efforts and in spite of, not because of, the U.S. government.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>如果你接受人民是或应该是国家的资产这一前提，昂纳克的墙是有意义的。没有墙的柏林对共产党人来说是一个漏洞，就像退出美国税收管辖对克林顿的国税局来说是一个漏洞一样。克林顿关于退出亿万富翁的论点，除了显示出一个政治家对数字完整性的惯常漠视之外，与霍内克的论点有相似之处，但在某种程度上不太符合逻辑，因为事实上，美国政府对可能寻求退出的富裕公民并没有大量的经济投资。这并不是他们在接受了国家资助的教育后，想溜到别的地方去从事法律工作的问题。绝大多数适用退出税的人都是通过自己的努力创造了财富，尽管有美国政府，而不是因为有美国政府。</p>

            <!-- <p>With the top 1 percent of taxpayers paying 30.2 percent of the total income tax in the United States (1995), it is not a question of the rich failing to repay any genuine investment the state may have made in their education or economic prosperity. To the contrary. Those who pay most of the bills pay vastly more than the value of any benefits they receive. With an average annual tax payment exceeding $125,000, taxes cost the top 1 percent of American taxpayers far more than they now realize. Assuming they could earn even a 10 percent return on the excess tax paid by each over a forty-year period, each $5,000 of annual excess tax payment reduced their net worth by $2.2 million. At a 20 percent rate of return, each $5,000 of excess tax reduces net worth by $44 million.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在美国，最高的 1% 的纳税人支付了总所得税的 30.2%（1995 年），这不是一个富人无法偿还国家对他们的教育或经济繁荣可能做出的任何真正投资的问题。恰恰相反。那些支付大部分账单的人所支付的费用远远超过了他们所获得的任何利益的价值。平均每年的纳税额超过 125,000 美元，税收对美国最高 1% 的纳税人的影响远远超过他们现在的认识。假设他们在四十年的时间里能从每人支付的超额税款中获得哪怕是 10% 的回报，每年每多支付 5000 美元的税款就会使他们的净资产减少 220
                万美元。在 20% 的回报率下，每 5,000 美元的超额税款会使净资产减少 4400 万美元。</p>

            <!-- <p>As the millennium approaches, the new megapolitical conditions of the Information Age will make it increasingly obvious that the nation-state inherited from the industrial era is a predatory institution. With each year that passes, it will seem less a boon to prosperity and more an obstacle, one from which the individual will want an escape. It is an escape that desperate governments will be loath to allow. The stability and even the survival of Western welfare states depends upon their ability to continue extracting a huge fraction of the world’s total output for redistribution to a subset of voters in the OECD countries. This requires that the taxes imposed upon the most productive citizens of the currently rich countries be priced at supermonopoly rates, hundreds or even thousands of times higher than the actual cost of the services that governments provide in return.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>随着千禧年的到来，信息时代新的跨政治条件将使人们越来越清楚地看到，从工业时代继承下来的领土国家是一个掠夺性机构。随着时间的推移，它似乎不再是繁荣的助推器，而更像是一个障碍，一个个人想要退出的障碍。绝望的政府将不愿意允许这种逃避。西方福利国家的稳定甚至生存，取决于他们是否有能力继续抽取世界总产出的很大一部分，重新分配给 OECD 国家的一部分选民。这就要求对目前富国最具生产力的公民征收的税款以超级垄断的价格定价，比政府提供的服务的实际成本高几百甚至几千倍。</p>

            <!-- <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall was more than just a visible symbol of the death of Communism. It was a defeat for the entire world system of nation-states and a triumph of efficiency and markets. The fulcrum of power underlying history has shifted. We believe that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 culminates the era of the nation-state, a peculiar two-hundred-year phase in history that began with the French Revolution. States have existed for six thousand years. But before the nineteenth century, they accounted for only a small fraction of the world’s sovereignties. Their ascendancy began and ended in revolution. The great events of 1789 launched Europe on a course toward truly national governments. The great events of 1989 marked the death of Communism and an assertion of control by market forces over massed power. Those two revolutions, exactly two hundred years apart, define the era in which the nation-state predominated in the Great Power system. The Great Powers, in turn, dominated the world, spreading or imposing state systems on even the most remote tribal enclave.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>柏林墙的倒塌不仅仅是共产主义死亡的一个明显象征。它是整个世界领土国家体系的一次失败，是效率和市场的胜利。历史上的权力支点已经转移。我们认为，1989 年柏林墙的倒塌将领土国家的时代推向了高潮，从法国大革命开始算的话，这是一个奇特的两百年历史阶段。国家已经存在了六千年之久。但在十九世纪之前，它们只占世界主权国家的一小部分。他们的地位在革命中开始，也在革命中结束。1789 年的伟大事件使欧洲走上了真正的国家政府的道路。1989 年的伟大事件标志着共产主义的死亡和市场力量对大众力量的控制。这两场革命相隔整整
                200 年，定义了领土国家在大国体系中占主导地位的时代。大国反过来又主宰了世界，甚至在最偏远的飞地上传播或强加国家制度。</p>

            <!-- <p>The triumph of the state as the principal vehicle for organizing violence in the world was not a matter of ideology. It was necessitated by the hidden logic of violence.

            <p>国家作为组织世界暴力的主要工具所取得的胜利并不是一个意识形态的问题。它是由暴力的隐秘逻辑所决定的。正如我们喜欢说的那样，这是一个巨大的政治事件，与其说是由理论家和政治家的愿望决定的，甚至是由将军们的操纵决定的，不如说是由隐藏的暴力杠杆决定的，它以阿基米德曾经梦想的方式推动着历史。</p>

            <!-- <p>States have been the norm for the past two hundred years of the modern period. But in the longer sweep of history, states have been rare. They have always depended upon extraordinary megapolitical conditions for their viability. Prior to the modern period, most states were “Oriental despotisms,” agricultural societies in deserts dependent upon control of irrigation systems for their survival. Even the Roman Empire, through its control of Egypt and North Africa, was indirectly a hydraulic society. But not enough of one to survive. Rome, like most premodern states, ultimately lacked the capacity to compel adherence to the monopoly of violence that the ability to starve people provides. The Roman state outside of Africa could not cut off water for growing crops by denying unsubmissive people access to the irrigation system. Such hydraulic systems supplied more leverage to violence than any other megapolitical configuration in the ancient economy. Whoever controlled the water in these societies could extract spoils at a level almost comparable to the percentage of total output absorbed by modern nation-states.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en7" id="text00011.html#ch05en7">7</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在现代时期的过去两百年里，国家一直是常态。但从更长远的历史来看，国家一直是罕见的。它们的生存能力总是依赖于特殊的跨政治条件。在现代时期之前，大多数国家都是『东方专制主义』，沙漠中的农业社会依赖对灌溉系统的控制而生存。即使是罗马帝国，通过对埃及和北非的控制，也间接地成为一个水利社会。但这并不足以使其生存。罗马，像大多数前现代国家一样，最终缺乏迫使人们遵守暴力垄断的能力，而这种能力是能饿死人的。非洲以外的罗马国家不可能通过拒绝不顺从的人进入灌溉系统来切断种植作物的水。巨大的水力系统为农作物的生长提供了更多的杠杆作用。这种水利系统比古代经济中的任何其他『跨政治』配置都能提供更多的暴力杠杆。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en7" id="text00011.html#ch05en7">7</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>This brings us to one of the great unanswered puzzles of modern history: why the Cold War that came at the conclusion of the Great Power system pitted as its final contenders Communist dictatorships against democratic welfare states. This issue has been so little examined that it actually seemed plausible to many when a State Department analyst, Francis Fukuyama, proclaimed “the end of history” after the Berlin Wall fell. The enthusiastic audience his work elicited took too much for granted. Apparently neither the author nor many others had bothered to ask a fundamental question: What common characteristics of state socialism and welfare-state democracies led them to be the final contenders for world domination?</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这让我们看到了现代史上的一个巨大的未解之谜：为什么在大国体制结束后的冷战中，共产主义独裁国家与民主福利国家成为最后的竞争者。这个问题很少被研究，以至于当国务院分析员弗朗西斯·福山在柏林墙倒塌后宣称『历史的终结』时，许多人似乎都觉得很有道理。他的作品所引起的热情的听众认为太理所当然了。显然，作者和其他许多人都没有费心去问一个基本问题。国家社会主义和福利国家的民主制度有什么共同特点，导致它们成为世界统治的最后竞争者？</p>

            <!-- <p>This is an important issue. After all, dozens of contending systems of sovereignty have come and gone in the past five centuries, including absolute monarchies, tribal enclaves, prince-bishoprics, direct rule by the pope, sultanates, city-states, and Anabaptist colonies. Today, most people would be surprised to learn that a hospital management company, with its own armed forces, could rule a country for centuries. Yet something very like that happened. For three hundred years after 1228, the Teutonic Knights of St. Mary’s Hospital at Jerusalem, later united with the Knights of the Sword of Livonia, ruled East Prussia and various territories in Eastern Europe, including parts of Lithuania and Poland. Then came the Gunpowder Revolution. Within decades, the Teutonic Knights were expelled as sovereigns of all their territories and their Grand Master was of no more military importance than a chess champion. Why? Why did so many other systems of sovereignty dwindle to insignificance while the great struggle for world power at the end of the Industrial Age saw mass democracies lined up against state socialist systems?</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这是个重要的问题。毕竟，在过去的五个世纪里，几十种争夺主权的制度来来往往，包括绝对君主制、飞地、王子主教制、教皇直接统治、苏丹国、城邦和再洗礼派殖民地。今天，大多数人都会惊讶地发现，一个拥有自己武装力量的医院管理公司可以统治一个国家长达几个世纪。然而，非常类似的事情发生了。1228 年后的三百年间，耶路撒冷圣玛丽医院的条顿骑士团，后来与利沃尼亚之剑骑士团联合起来，统治了东普鲁士和东欧的各个领土国家，包括立陶宛和波兰的部分地区。然后是火药革命。在几十年内，条顿骑士团被逐出其所有领土国家的主权，他们的大团长在军事上的重要性不亚于国际象棋冠军。为什么？为什么在工业时代结束时，在争夺世界权力的伟大斗争中，大众民主国家与国家社会主义制度一字排开，而其他许多主权制度却渐渐变得无足轻重呢？</p>

The answer is that a lean sumo wrestler, however impressive his ratio of strength to weight, cannot compete with another wrestler who is gigantic. As Tilly suggests, the important issue was “effectiveness (total output),” not “efficiency (the ratio of output to input).” In an increasingly violent world, the systems that predominated through five centuries of competition were necessarily those that facilitated the greatest access to resources needed to make war on a large scale.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>我们的『跨政治』学理论指出了答案。这就像问为什么相扑运动员往往是胖子一样。答案是，一个瘦小的相扑运动员，无论他的力量与体重的比例有多大，都无法与另一个巨大的摔跤手竞争。正如蒂利所建议的，重要的问题是『有效性（总产出）』，而不是『效率（产出与投入的比率）』。在一个日益暴力的世界里，在五个世纪的竞争中占主导地位的系统必然是那些有利于最大限度地获得大规模战争所需资源的系统。</p>

            <!-- <p>How did this work?</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这一点是如何做到的？</p>

            <!-- <p>In the case of Communism, the answer is obvious. Under Communism, those who controlled the state controlled almost everything. If you had been a citizen of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the KGB could have taken your toothbrush if they had thought it useful for their purposes to do so. They could have taken your teeth. According to credible estimates that have become more credible since the opening of former Soviet archives in 1992, secret police and other agents of the late Soviet state took the lives of 50 million persons in seventy-four years of rule. The state socialist system was in a position to mobilize anything that existed within its boundaries for its military, with little likelihood that anyone living there would argue.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在共产主义的情况下，答案是显而易见的。在共产主义下，那些控制国家的人几乎控制了一切。如果你在冷战期间是苏联的公民，克格勃可以拿走你的牙刷，如果他们认为这样做对他们的目的有用的话。他们可以拿走你的牙齿。根据 1992 年开放前苏联档案后变得更加可信的估计，秘密警察和已故苏联国家的其他代理人在七十四年的统治中夺走了五千万人的生命。这个国家社会主义制度能够调动其境内的任何东西用于军事，而生活在那里的人几乎不可能反驳。</p>

            <!-- <p>In the case of Western democracies, the story is less obvious, partly because we are accustomed to think of democracy in stark contrast to Communism. In terms of the Industrial Age, the two systems were indeed great opposites. But seen from the perspective of the Information Age, the two systems had more in common than you might suspect. Both facilitated unimpeded control of resources by government. The difference was that the democratic welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of the state than the state socialist systems.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在西方民主国家的情况下，这个故事不那么明显，部分原因是我们习惯于将民主与共产主义形成鲜明的对比。从工业时代的角度来看，这两种制度的确是巨大的对立面。但从信息时代的角度来看，这两种制度的共同点比你想象的要多。两者都有利于政府不受阻碍地控制资源。不同的是，与国家社会主义制度相比，民主福利国家将更多的资源掌握在国家手中。</p>

            <!-- <p>This is a clear-cut example of a rare phenomenon, less being more. The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state owned everything. The democratic welfare state, by contrast, made more modest claims, and thereby employed superior incentives to mobilize greater output. Instead of laying claim to everything in the beginning, governments in the West allowed individuals to own property and accumulate wealth. Then, after the wealth had been accumulated, the Western nation-states taxed a large fraction of it away. Property taxes, income taxes, and estate taxes at high levels furnished the democratic welfare state with prodigious quantities of resources compared to those available through the state socialist systems.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这是一个罕见现象的明显例子，即少即是多。国家社会主义制度是以国家拥有一切的理论为前提的。相比之下，民主的福利国家提出了更适度的要求，因此采用了更好的激励措施来动员更大的产出。西方国家的政府不是一开始就要求拥有一切，而是允许个人拥有财产和积累财富。然后，在财富积累后，西方领土国家对其中的一大部分征税。与国家社会主义制度相比，高水平的财产税、所得税和遗产税为民主福利国家提供了数量巨大的资源。</p>

            <!-- <p>When you come to understand why, you are much closer to recognizing what the fall of the Berlin Wall and the death of Communism really mean. Far from assuring that the democratic welfare state will be a triumphant system, as has been widely assumed, it was more like seeing that a fraternal twin has died of old age. The same megapolitical revolution that killed Communism is also likely to undermine and destroy democratic welfare states as we have known them in the twentieth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>The key to this unorthodox conclusion lies in recognizing where the control of democratic government is lodged. It is an issue that is not as simple as it may seem. In the modern era, the question of who controls the government has almost always been asked as a political question. It has had many answers, but almost uniformly these involved identifying the political party, group, or faction that dominated the control of a particular state at a particular moment. You have heard of governments controlled by capitalists. Governments controlled by labor. Governments controlled by Catholics, and by Islamic fundamentalists. Governments controlled by tribal and racial groups; governments controlled by Hutus and governments by whites. You have also heard of governments controlled by occupational groups, such as lawyers or bankers. You have heard of governments controlled by rural interests, by big-city machines and by people living in the suburbs. And you have certainly heard of governments controlled by political parties, by Democrats, Conservatives, Christian Democrats, Liberals, Radicals, Republicans, and Socialists.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这个非正统的结论的关键在于认识到民主政府的控制权在哪里。这个问题并不像它看起来那么简单。在现代社会，谁控制政府的问题几乎总是作为一个政治问题被提出。这个问题有很多答案，但几乎都是涉及到确定在某一特定时刻主宰某一国家控制权的政党、团体或派系。你已经听说过由资本家控制的政府、由劳工控制的政府、由天主教徒和伊斯兰原教旨主义者控制的政府、由部落和种族团体控制的政府、由胡图人控制的政府和由白人控制的政府，你也听说过由职业团体控制的政府，如律师或银行家。你们听说过由农村利益集团控制的政府，由大城市的机器和生活在郊区的人控制的政府。你当然也听说过由政党控制的政府，如民主党、保守党、基督教民主党、自由党、激进党、共和党和社会党。</p>

            <!-- <p>But you probably have not heard much about a government controlled by its customers. Economic historian Frederic Lane laid the basis for a new way of understanding, where the control of government lies in some of his lucid essays on the economic consequences of violence discussed earlier. Thinking about government as an economic unit that sells protection led Lane to analyze the control of government in economic rather than political terms. In this view, there are three basic alternatives in the control of government, each of which entails a fundamentally different set of incentives: proprietors, employees, and customers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>但是，你可能没有听说过由客户控制的政府的情况。经济史学家弗雷德里克·莱恩（<em>Frederic Lane</em>）为一种新的理解方式奠定了基础，在他前面讨论的关于暴力的经济后果的一些清晰的文章中，政府的控制权在于此。将政府视为出售安保的经济单位，使莱恩从经济而非政治角度分析政府的控制。在这种观点中，在政府控制方面有三种基本的选择，每一种都包含了一套根本不同的激励机制：业主、雇员和客户。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Proprietors</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>业主</h3>

            <!-- <p>In rare cases, even today, governments are sometimes controlled by a proprietor, usually a hereditary leader who for all intents and purposes owns the country. For example, the Sultan of Brunei treats the government of Brunei somewhat like a proprietorship. This was more common among lords of the Middle Ages, who treated their fiefs as proprietorships to optimize their incomes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在极少数情况下，甚至在今天，政府有时会被一个经营者控制，通常是一个世袭的领导人，就所有的意图和目的而言，他拥有这个国家。例如，文莱苏丹对待文莱政府的态度有点像业主。这在中世纪的领主中比较常见，他们把自己的封地当作独资企业，以优化他们的收入。</p>

            <!-- <p>Lane described the incentives of “the owners of the production-producing enterprise” as follows:</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            </blockquote>

            <!-- <p>Governments controlled by proprietors have strong incentives to reduce the costs of providing protection or monopolizing violence in a given area. But so long as their rule is secure, they have little incentive to reduce the price (tax) they charge their customers below the rate that optimizes revenues. The higher the price a monopolist can charge, and the lower his actual costs, the greater the profit he will make. The ideal fiscal policy for a government controlled by its proprietors would be a huge surplus. When governments can keep their revenues high but cut their costs, this has a large impact on the use of resources. Labor and other valuable inputs that would otherwise be wasted providing unnecessarily expensive protection become available instead for investment and other purposes. The higher the monarch can raise his profit by lowering costs, the more resources are freed. When these resources are used for investment, they provide a stimulus for growth. But even if they are used for conspicuous consumption, they help create and feed new markets that otherwise would not exist if the resources had been wasted to produce inefficient “protection.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由业主控制的政府有强烈的动机来降低在特定地区提供保护或垄断暴力的成本。但是，只要他们的统治是安全的，他们就没有什么动机将他们向客户收取的价格（税收）降低到低于优化收入的比率。垄断者可以收取的价格越高，而他的实际成本越低，他的利润就越大。对于一个由经营者控制的政府来说，理想的财政政策是巨大的盈余。当政府可以保持高收入但削减成本时，这对资源的使用有很大影响。劳动力和其他有价值的投入，否则就会被浪费在提供不必要的昂贵保护上，转而可用于投资和其他目的。君主通过降低成本提高利润的幅度越大，释放的资源就越多。当这些资源被用于投资时，它们会刺激增长。但是，即使它们被用于炫耀性消费，它们也有助于创造和哺育新的市场，否则，如果这些资源被浪费在生产低效的『保护』上，这些市场就不会存在。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Employees</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>雇员</h3>

            <!-- <p>It is easy to characterize the incentives that prevail for governments controlled by their employees. They would be similar incentives in other employee-controlled organizations. First and foremost, employee-run organizations tend to favor any policy that increases employment and oppose measures which reduce jobs. As Lane put it, “When employees as a whole controlled, they had little interest in minimizing the amounts exacted for protection and none in minimizing that large part of costs represented by labor costs, by their own salaries. Maximizing size was more to their taste also.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en10" id="text00011.html#ch05en10">10</a></sup>A government controlled by its employees would seldom have incentives to either reduce the costs of government or the price charged to their customers. However, where conditions impose strong price resistance, in the form of opposition to higher taxes, governments controlled by employees would be more likely to let their revenues fall below their outlays than to cut their outlays. In other words, their incentives imply that they may be inclined toward chronic deficits, as governments controlled by proprietors would not be.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>对于由雇员控制的政府来说，很容易描述其激励机制的特点。它们在其他雇员控制的组织中也会有类似的激励。首先，雇员控制的组织倾向于支持任何增加就业的政策，反对减少就业的措施。正如莱恩所说：『当雇员作为一个整体进行控制时，他们对最大限度地减少保护费没有兴趣，对最大限度地减少由劳动力成本和他们自己的工资所代表的那部分成本也没有兴趣。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en10" id="text00011.html#ch05en10">10</a></sup>一个由雇员控制的政府很少有动力去降低政府的成本或对客户的收费价格。然而，如果条件对价格有强烈的抵制，即反对提高税收，由雇员控制的政府将更有可能让其收入低于其支出，而不是削减其支出。换句话说，他们的动机意味着他们可能会倾向于长期赤字，而由业主控制的政府则不会。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Customers</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>客户</h3>

            <!-- <p>Are there examples of governments controlled by their customers? Yes. Lane was inspired to analyze the control of government in economic terms by the example of the medieval merchant republics, like Venice. There a group of wholesale merchants who required protection effectively controlled the government for centuries. They were genuinely customers for the protection service government provided, not proprietors. They paid for the service. They did not seek to profit from their control of government’s monopoly of violence. If some did, they were prevented from doing so by the other customers for long periods of time. Other examples of governments controlled by their customers include democracies and republics with limited franchise, such as the ancient democracies, or the American republic in its founding period. At that time, only those who paid for the government, about 10 percent of the population, were allowed to vote.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>是否存在由客户控制的政府的例子？是的。莱恩从威尼斯等中世纪商人共和国的例子中得到启发，从经济角度分析了政府的控制。在那里，一群需要保护的批发商人在几个世纪里有效地控制了政府。他们是政府提供的保护服务的真正客户，而不是业主。他们为这种服务付费。他们并不寻求从控制政府的暴力垄断中获利。如果有些人这样做了，他们也会被其他客户长期阻止这样做。其他由客户控制的政府的例子包括民主国家和有限的特许权的共和国，如古代的民主国家，或建国时期的美国共和国。当时，只有那些为政府付费的人（约占人口的
                10%）才被允许投票。
            </p>

            <!-- <p>Governments controlled by their customers, like those of proprietors, have incentives to reduce their operating costs as far as possible. But unlike governments controlled by either proprietors or employees, governments actually controlled by their customers have incentives to hold down the prices they charge. Where customers rule, governments are lean and generally unobtrusive, with low operating costs, minimal employment, and low taxes. A government controlled by its customers sets tax rates not to optimize the amount the government can collect but rather to optimize the amount that the customers can retain. Like typical enterprises in competitive markets, even a monopoly controlled by its customers would be compelled to move toward efficiency. It would not be able to charge a price, in the form of taxes, that exceeded costs by more than a bare margin.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由客户控制的政府，就像那些业主的政府一样，有动机尽可能地降低其运营成本。但与经营者或雇员控制的政府不同，由客户实际控制的政府有动力压低他们的价格。在客户统治的地方，政府是精干的，一般不引人注目，有低的运营成本，最小的就业和低的税收。一个由客户控制的政府制定税率，不是为了优化政府可以收取的金额，而是为了优化客户可以保留的金额。像竞争性市场中的典型企业一样，即使是由客户控制的垄断企业也会被迫向效率方向发展。它将不能以税收的形式收取超出成本的价格，而只收取最低限度的费用。</p>

            <!-- <h2>THE ROLE OF DEMOCRACY: VOTERS AS EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h2>民主的作用：作为雇员和客户的选民</h2>

            <!-- <p>Lane treats democracy in the conventional way in assuming that it brings violence-using and violence-producing enterprises “increasingly under the control of their customers.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en11" id="text00011.html#ch05en11">11</a></sup>This is certainly the politically correct conclusion. But is it true? We think not. Look closely at how modern democracies function.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>莱恩以传统的方式对待民主，认为它使使用暴力和生产暴力的企业『越来越受其客户的控制。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en11" id="text00011.html#ch05en11">11</a></sup>这无疑是政治上正确的结论。但这是真的吗？我们认为不是。仔细观察一下现代民主国家是如何运作的。</p>

            <!-- <p>First of all, they have few characteristics of those competitive industries where the terms of trade are clearly controlled by their customers. For one thing, democratic governments typically spend only a bare fraction of their total outlays on the service of protection, which is their core activity. In the United States, for example, state and local governments spend just 3.5 percent of their total outlays on the provision of police, as well as courts and prisons. Add military spending, and the fraction of revenues devoted to protection is still only about 10 percent. Another revealing hint that mass democracy is not controlled by its customers is the fact that contemporary political culture, inherited from the Industrial Age, would consider it outrageous if policies on crucial issues were actually informed by the interests of the people who pay the bills. Imagine the uproar if a U.S. president or a British prime minister proposed to allow the group of citizens who pay the majority of the taxes to determine which programs of government should continue and which groups of employees should be fired. This would deeply offend expectations of how government should operate, in a way that allowing government employees to determine whose taxes should be raised would not.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>首先，它们几乎没有那些竞争性行业的特征，在这些行业中，贸易条件明显由客户控制。首先，民主政府通常只将其总支出的一小部分用于保护服务，而这正是其核心活动。例如，在美国，州和地方政府仅将其总支出的 3.5% 用于提供警察、法院和监狱。加上军事开支，用于保护的收入比例仍然只有 10% 左右。另一个揭示大众民主不受其客户控制的暗示是，从工业时代继承下来的当代政治文化认为，如果在关键问题上的政策实际上是由支付账单的人的利益来决定的，那就太离谱了。想象一下，如果美国总统或英国首相提议让支付大部分税款的公民群体来决定政府的哪些项目应该继续，哪些雇员群体应该被解雇，会引起多大的反响。这将深深地触犯人们对政府应该如何运作的期望，而允许政府雇员决定谁应该加税的方式则不会。</p>

            <!-- <p>Yet when you think about it, when customers really are in the driver’s seat it would be considered outrageous that they should not get what they want. If you went into a store to buy furniture, and the salespeople took your money but then proceeded to ignore your requests and consult others about how to spend your money, you would quite rightly be upset. You would not think it normal or justifiable if the employees of the store argued that you really did not deserve the furniture, and that it should be shipped instead to someone whom they found more worthy. The fact that something very like this happens in dealings with government shows how little control its “customers” actually have.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，当你想一想，当客户真正处于主导地位时，他们不应该得到他们想要的东西，这将被认为是很过分的。如果你进入一家商店购买家具，销售人员收了你的钱，但随后却无视你的要求，并向其他人咨询如何使用你的钱，你会很有理由感到不安。如果商店的员工认为你真的不配拥有这些家具，而应该把它们运给他们认为更有价值的人，你会认为这不正常，也没有理由。在与政府打交道的过程中，类似的事情发生了，这说明政府的『客户』实际上没有多少控制权。</p>

            <!-- <p>By any measure, the costs of democratic government have surged out of control, unlike the typical situation where customer preferences force vendors to be efficient. Most democracies run chronic deficits. This is a fiscal policy characteristic of control by employees. Governments seem notably resistant to reducing the costs of their operations. An almost universal complaint about contemporary government worldwide is that political programs, once established, can be curtailed only with great difficulty. To fire a government employee is all but impossible. In fact, one of the principal advantages arising from privatization of formerly state-owned functions is that private control usually makes it far easier to weed out unnecessary employment. From Britain to Argentina, it has not been uncommon for the new private managers to shed 50-95 percent of former state employees.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>无论从哪个角度来看，民主政府的成本都已经失去控制，这与客户偏好迫使供应商提高效率的典型情况不同。大多数民主国家都有长期赤字。这是一个由雇员控制的财政政策特点。政府似乎对降低其运营成本有明显的抵触。世界各地对当代政府的一个几乎普遍的抱怨是，政治项目一旦建立，只有在非常困难的情况下才能被削减。炒掉一个政府雇员几乎是不可能的。事实上，以前国有职能的私有化所带来的主要优势之一是，私人控制通常会使剔除不必要的就业变得更加容易。从英国到阿根廷，新的私人管理者将原来的国家雇员减少了 50-95%，这种情况并不罕见。
            </p>

            <!-- <p>Think, as well, of the basis upon which the fiscal terms of government’s protection service is priced. For the most part, you would look in vain for hints of competitive influences on tax rates according to which government services are priced. Even the occasional debates about lowering taxes that have interrupted normal political discourse in recent years betray how far removed democratic government has normally been from control by its customers. Advocates of lower taxes sometimes have argued that government revenues would actually increase because rates previously had been set so high that they discouraged economic activity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>另外，想想政府保护服务的财政条款是以什么为基础定价的。在大多数情况下，你会徒劳地寻找关于政府服务定价所依据的税率的竞争影响的暗示。即使是近年来中断正常政治讨论的关于降税的偶尔辩论，也暴露了民主政府通常离其客户的控制有多远。主张降低税收的人有时会争辩说，政府的收入实际上会增加，因为以前的税率定得太高，以至于阻碍了经济活动。</p>

            <!-- <p>The trade-off they normally intended to highlight was not competition between jurisdictions but something much more amazing. They did not argue that because tax rates in Hong Kong were only 15 percent, rates in the United States or Germany must be no higher than 15 percent. To the contrary. Tax debates have normally assumed that the trade-off facing the taxpayer was not between doing business in one jurisdiction or doing it in another, but between doing business at penal rates or taking a holiday. You were told that productive individuals subject to predatory taxation would walk away from their in-boxes and go golfing if their tax burdens were not eased.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>他们通常打算强调的权衡不是管辖区之间的竞争，而是更惊人的东西。他们并没有争辩说，因为香港的税率只有 15%，所以美国或德国的税率一定不会高于 15%。恰恰相反。税收辩论通常假定，纳税人所面临的权衡不是在一个司法管辖区做生意还是在另一个司法管辖区做生意，而是在以惩罚性税率做生意还是放假。有人告诉你，如果不减轻他们的税收负担，受到掠夺性征税的有产者将再也不想打开他们的邮箱，转而去打高尔夫球。</p>

            <!-- <p>The fact that such an argument could even arise shows how far removed from a competitive footing the protection costs imposed by democratic welfare states have been. The terms of progressive income taxation, which emerged in every democratic welfare state during the course of the twentieth century, are dramatically unlike pricing provisions that would be preferred by customers. This can easily be seen by comparing taxation imposed to support a monopolistic provision of protection with tariffs for telephone service, which until recently was a monopoly in most places. Customers would scream bloody murder if a telephone company attempted to charge for calls on the same basis that income taxes are imposed. Suppose the phone company sent a bill for $50,000 for a call to London, just because you happened to conclude a deal worth $125,000 during a conversation. Neither you nor any other customer in his right mind would pay it. But that is exactly the basis upon which income taxes are assessed in every democratic welfare state.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这样的论点甚至会出现，这表明民主福利国家所施加的保护成本与竞争基础相去甚远。在二十世纪的过程中，每个民主福利国家都出现了累进所得税的条款，这与客户喜欢的定价条款大不相同。这一点可以通过比较为支持垄断性保护而征收的税款与电话服务的费率而轻易看出，直到最近，电话服务在大多数地方都是垄断的。如果电话公司试图在征收所得税的基础上收取电话费，客户会大喊大叫。假设电话公司为打往伦敦的电话寄来一张 50,000 美元的账单，只是因为你在谈话中碰巧达成了一笔价值 125,000 美元的交易。无论是你还是任何其他头脑正常的客户都不会支付这笔费用。但这正是每个民主福利国家评估所得税的基础。
            </p>

            <!-- <p>When you think closely about the terms under which industrial democracies have operated, it is more logical to treat them as a form of government controlled by their employees. Thinking of mass democracy as government controlled by its employees helps explain the difficulty of changing government policy. Government in many respects appears to be run for the benefit of employees. For example, government schools in most democratic countries seem to malfunction chronically and without remedy. If customers truly were in the driver’s seat, they would find it easier to set new policy directions. Those who pay for democratic government seldom set the terms of government spending. Instead, government functions as a co-op that is both outside of proprietary control and operating as a natural monopoly. Prices bear little relation to costs. The quality of service is generally low compared to that in private enterprise. Customer grievances are hard to remedy. In short, mass democracy leads to control of government by its “employees.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当你仔细思考工业民主国家运作的条件时，把它们当作一种由其雇员控制的政府形式是更符合逻辑的。将大众民主视为由其雇员控制的政府有助于解释改变政府政策的困难。政府在许多方面似乎都是为了雇员的利益而运作的。例如，大多数民主国家的政府学校似乎长期处于故障状态，而且没有补救措施。如果客户真的在驾驶座上，他们会发现更容易制定新的政策方向。那些为民主政府付费的人很少制定政府支出的条款。相反，政府作为一个合作机构，既不在所有权控制范围内，又作为一个自然垄断机构运作。价格与成本几乎没有关系。与私营企业相比，服务质量普遍较低。客户的不满情绪很难得到纠正。简而言之，大众民主导致了政府被其『雇员』控制。</p>

            <!-- <p>But wait. You may be saying that in most jurisdictions there are many more voters than there are persons on the government payroll. How could it be possible for employees to dominate under such conditions? The welfare state emerged to answer exactly this quandary. Since there were not otherwise enough employees to create a working majority, increasing numbers of voters were effectively put on the payroll to receive transfer payments of all kinds. In effect, the recipients of transfer payments and subsidies became pseudo employees of government who were able to dispense with the bother of reporting every day to work. It was a result dictated by the megapolitical logic of the industrial age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>但是，等等。你可能会说，在大多数司法管辖区，选民比政府工资单上的人多得多。在这种情况下，雇员怎么可能占主导地位？福利国家的出现正是为了回答这个难题。由于没有足够的雇员来创造一个工作的大多数，越来越多的选民被有效地放在工资单上，接受各种转移支付。实际上，接受转移支付和补贴的人成了政府的假雇员，他们可以省去每天上班的麻烦。这是由工业时代的跨政治逻辑所决定的结果。</p>

            <!-- <p>When the magnitude of coercive force is more important than the efficient deployment of resources, as was the case prior to 1989, it is all but impossible for most governments to be controlled by their customers. As the example of the late Soviet Union illustrated so well, until a few years ago it was possible for states to exercise great power in the world even while wasting resources on a massive scale. When returns to violence are high and rising, magnitude means more than efficiency. Larger entities tend to prevail over smaller ones. Those governments that are more effective in mobilizing military resources, even at the cost of wasting many of them, tend to prevail over those that utilize resources more efficiently.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当强制力的大小比资源的有效配置更重要时，就像 1989 年之前的情况一样，大多数政府几乎不可能被其客户控制。正如晚期苏联的例子所说明的那样，直到几年前，国家有可能在世界上行使巨大的权力，即使在大规模浪费资源的情况下。当暴力的回报率很高且不断上升时，规模比效率更有意义。较大的实体往往比较小的实体更有优势。那些能更有效地调动军事资源的政府，即使以浪费许多资源为代价，也往往能战胜那些更有效地利用资源的政府。</p>

            <!-- <p>Think what this means. It inescapably implies that when magnitude means more than efficiency, governments controlled by their customers cannot prevail, and often, cannot survive. Under such conditions, the entities that will be most effectively militarily are those that commandeer the most resources for war. But governments that are truly controlled by their customers who pay their bills are unlikely to have carte blanche to reach into the pockets of everyone to extract resources.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>想一想这意味着什么。它不可避免地意味着，当规模比效率更有意义时，由客户控制的政府无法获胜，而且往往无法生存。在这种情况下，在军事上最有效的实体是那些征用最多战争资源的实体。但是，真正由支付账单的客户控制的政府，不太可能有全权委托，将手伸进每个人的口袋来提取资源。</p>

            <!-- <p>Customers normally wish to see the prices they pay for any product or service, including protection, lowered and kept under control. If the Western democracies had been under customer control during the Cold War, that fact alone would have made them weaker competitors militarily, because it would almost certainly have curtailed the flow of resources into the government. Remember, where customers rule, both prices and costs should be expected to be under tight control. But this is hardly what happened. The welfare states were manifestly the winners of the spending contest during the Cold War. Commentators of all stripes cited as a factor in their triumph their ability to spend the Soviet Union into bankruptcy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>客户通常希望看到他们为任何产品或服务（包括保护）所支付的价格降低并受到控制。如果西方民主国家在冷战期间处于客户控制之下，仅这一事实就会使它们在军事上成为较弱的竞争对手，因为它几乎肯定会遏制资源流入政府。记住，在客户统治的地方，价格和成本都应该受到严格控制。但这几乎没有发生。在冷战期间，福利国家显然是支出竞赛的赢家。各类评论家都把他们有能力把苏联花到破产作为他们胜利的因素。</p>

            <!-- <p>It is precisely this fact that highlights the way in which the inefficiencies of democracy made it megapolitically predominant during a period of rising returns to violence. Massive military spending, with all its waste, represents a distinctly suboptimal deployment of capital for private gain. We suggested earlier that while welfare states were economically efficient as compared to state socialist systems, they are far less efficient for the creation of wealth than <em>laissez-faire</em>enclaves, like Hong Kong. Ironically, it was this very inefficiency of the democratic welfare state as compared to a more unencumbered free-market system that made it successful—in the megapolitical conditions of industrialism.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正是这一事实凸显了在暴力回报率不断上升的时期，民主的低效率使其在跨政治上占据了主导地位。大规模的军费开支，及其所有的浪费，代表了一种明显的为私人利益而进行的次优资本部署。我们在前面提出，虽然与国家社会主义制度相比，福利国家在经济上是有效的，但它们在创造财富方面的效率却远远低于自由放任的飞地，比如香港。具有讽刺意味的是，正是这种民主福利国家与更无约束的自由市场制度相比的低效率，使得它在工业化的跨政治条件下获得了成功。</p>

            <!-- <p>How did inefficiency fostered by democracy become a factor in its success during the Age of Violence? The key to unraveling this apparent paradox lies in recognizing two points:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>民主制度所产生的低效率是如何在暴力时代成为其成功的因素的？解开这个明显的悖论的关键在于认识到两点：</p>

            <!-- <p>1. Success for a sovereignty in the modern period lay not in creating wealth but in creating a military force capable of deploying overpowering violence against any other state. Money was needed to do that, but money itself could not win a battle. The challenge was not to create a system with the most efficient economy or the most rapid rate of growth, but to create a system that could extract more resources and channel them into the military. By its nature, military spending is an area where the financial returns <em>per se</em>are low or nonexistent.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1. 在现代时期，一个主权国家的成功不在于创造财富，而在于建立一支能够对任何其他国家部署强有力的暴力的军事力量。要做到这一点需要金钱，但金钱本身并不能赢得一场战斗。挑战不是建立一个经济效率最高或增长速度最快的系统，而是建立一个能够提取更多资源并将其用于军事的系统。就其性质而言，军事开支是一个财政收益本身较低或不存在的领域。</p>

            <!-- <p>2. The easiest way to obtain permission to invest funds in activities with little or no direct financial return, like tax payments, is to ask for permission from someone other than the person whose money is coveted. One of the ways that the Dutch were able to purchase Manhattan for twenty-three dollars’ worth of beads is that the particular Indians to whom they made the offer were not the ones who properly owned it. “Getting to yes,” as the marketing people say, is much easier under those terms. Suppose, for example, that as authors of this book we wanted you to pay not its cover price but 40 percent of your annual income for a copy. We would be far likelier to get permission to do so if we asked someone else, and did not have to ask you. In fact, we would be far more persuasive if we could rely instead upon the consent of several people you do not even know. We could hold an <em>ad hoc</em>election, what H. L. Mencken described, with less exaggeration than he might have thought, as “an advanced auction of stolen goods.” And to make the example more realistic, we would agree to share some of the money we collected from you with these anonymous bystanders in exchange for their support.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>2. 要想获得许可，将资金投入到几乎没有直接经济回报的活动中去，比如缴税，最简单的方法就是向资金被觊觎的人以外的人请求许可。荷兰人能够用价值二十三美元的珠子购买曼哈顿的方法之一是，他们向其提出报价的特定印第安人并不是正确拥有它的人。正如营销人员所说，在这些条件下，『达成协议』要容易得多。例如，假设作为这本书的作者，我们希望你支付的不是封面价格，而是你年收入的 40% 来购买一本。如果我们问别人，而不是问你，我们就更有可能得到这样做的许可。事实上，如果我们能依靠几个你甚至不认识的人的同意，我们会更有说服力。我们可以举行一次『任务型选举』，即

            <!-- <p>That is the role the modern democratic welfare state evolved to fulfill. It was an unsurpassed system in the Industrial Age because it was both efficient and inefficient where it counted. It combined the efficiency of private ownership and incentives for the creation of wealth with a mechanism to facilitate essentially unchecked access to that wealth. Democracy kept the pockets of wealth producers open. It succeeded militarily during the high-water period of rising returns to violence in the world precisely because it made it difficult for customers to effectively restrict the taxes the government collected or other ways of funding the outlay of resources for the military, such as inflation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这就是现代民主福利国家演变出的角色。在工业时代，它是一个无与伦比的系统，因为它在重要的地方既高效又低效。它结合了私有制的效率和创造财富的激励机制，以及一个基本上不受限制地获取这些财富的机制。民主使财富生产者的口袋保持开放。在世界暴力回报率上升的高发期，它在军事上取得了成功，正是因为它使客户难以有效地限制政府征收的税收或其他为军事资源支出提供资金的方式，如通货膨胀。</p>

            <h3>为什么客户不能主宰</h3>

            <!-- <p>Those who paid for “protection” during the modern period were not in a position to successfully deny resources to the sovereign, even acting collectively, when doing so would simply have exposed them to being overpowered by other, possibly more hostile states. This was an obvious consideration during the Cold War. The customers, or taxpayers, who bore a disproportionate share of the cost of government in the leading Western industrial states were in no position to refuse to pay hefty taxes. The result would have been to expose themselves to total confiscation by the Soviet Union or another aggressive group capable of organizing violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在现代时期，那些为『保护』付费的人没有能力成功地拒绝向主权国家提供资源，哪怕是集体行动，因为这样做只会使他们被其他可能更具敌意的国家所压制。这在冷战时期是一个明显的考虑。在领先的西方工业国中，承担了过多政府成本的客户或纳税人没有能力拒绝支付高额的税收。其结果将是使自己面临苏联或其他有能力组织暴力的侵略集团的全面没收。</p>

            <h3>工业主义和民主</h3>

            <!-- <p>Taking a longer view, mass democracy may prove to be an anachronism that will not long survive the end of the Industrial Age. Certainly, mass democracy and the nation-state emerged together with the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century, probably as a response to a surge in real income. Incomes had begun to rise significantly in Western Europe about 1750, partly as a result of warmer weather. This coincided with a period of technological innovation that displaced skilled jobs of artisans with equipment that could be operated by unskilled workers, even women and children. This new industrial equipment raised earnings for unskilled workers, making the income distribution more equal.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从更长远的角度来看，大众民主可能会被证明是一个不合时宜的东西，在工业时代结束后也不会长久。当然，大众民主和领土国家是在十八世纪末的法国大革命中出现的，这可能是对实际收入激增的回应。1750 年左右，西欧的收入开始大幅上升，部分原因是天气变暖。这与技术革新时期相吻合，技术革新用非熟练工人，甚至妇女和儿童都能操作的设备取代了工匠的熟练工作。这种新的工业设备提高了非技术工人的收入，使收入分配更加平等。</p>

            <!-- <p>The crucial trigger point of revolution may not have been, as is often thought, the perverse idea that people tend to revolt when conditions improve. More important may be the fact that when incomes had risen to a certain level, it at last became practical for the early-modern state to circumvent the private intermediaries and powerful magnates with whom they had previously bargained for resources, and move to a system of “direct rule” in which a national government dealt directly with individual citizens, taxing them at ever higher rates and demanding poorly compensated military service in exchange for provision of various benefits.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en12" id="text00011.html#ch05en12">12</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>革命的关键触发点可能并不像人们通常认为的那样，是人们在条件改善时倾向于造反的反常想法。更重要的可能是，当收入上升到一定水平时，早期现代国家终于可以绕过以前与之讨价还价的私人中介和权贵，转而采用『直接统治』的制度，由国家政府直接与公民个人打交道，以越来越高的税率向他们征税，并要求以低报酬的军事服务作为提供各种福利的交换。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en12" id="text00011.html#ch05en12">12</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Because the emerging middle class soon had enough money to tax, it was no longer essential, as it previously had been, for rulers to negotiate with powerful landlords or great merchants who were, as historian Charles Tilly wrote, “in a position to prevent the creation of a powerful state” that would “seize their assets and cramp their transactions.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en13" id="text00011.html#ch05en13">13</a></sup>It is easy to see why governments were more successful in extracting resources when they dealt with millions of citizens individually rather than with a relative handful of lords, dukes, earls, bishops, contract mercenaries, free cities, and other semisovereign entities with whom the rulers of European states were obliged to negotiate prior to the mid-eighteenth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由于新兴的中产阶级很快就有足够的钱来征税，统治者不再像以前那样必须与强大的地主或大商人进行谈判，正如历史学家查尔斯·蒂利所写的那样，他们『有能力阻止建立一个强大的国家，从而，扣押他们的资产并压制他们的交易。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en13" id="text00011.html#ch05en13">13</a></sup>不难看出，当政府与数以百万计的公民单独打交道时，而不是与相对少数的领主、公爵、伯爵、主教、合同雇佣兵、自由城市和其他半主权实体打交道时，政府在提取资源方面会更加成功，因为在十八世纪中期以前，欧洲国家的统治者必须与这些实体进行谈判。</p>

            <!-- <p>Rising real incomes allowed governments to adopt a strategy that placed more resources under their control. Small sums taken in taxes from millions could produce more revenue than larger amounts paid by a few powerful people. What is more, the many were far easier to deal with than the few, who were generally unwilling to give their money away and were far better placed to resist.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>实际收入的增加使政府能够采取一种将更多的资源置于其控制之下的策略。从数以百万计的人身上征收的小额税款比少数有权势的人支付的大额税款可以产生更多的收入。更重要的是，许多人比少数人更容易对付，因为少数人通常不愿意把他们的钱送出去，而且更有条件进行抵抗。</p>

            <!-- <p>After all, the typical farmer, small merchant, or worker possessed vanishingly small resources as compared to the state itself. It was not even remotely possible that the typical private individual in Western Europe on the eve of the French Revolution could have effectively bargained with the state to reduce his tax rate, or mounted an effective resistance to government plans and policies that threatened his interests. But this is precisely what powerful private magnates had done for centuries and would continue to do. They effectively resisted and bargained with rulers, restraining their ability to commandeer resources.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>毕竟，与国家本身相比，典型的农民、小商人或工人拥有的资源少得可怜。在法国大革命前夕，西欧典型的个人根本不可能与国家有效地讨价还价以降低其税率，或对威胁其利益的政府计划和政策进行有效抵抗。但这恰恰是几个世纪以来有权势的私人大亨们所做的，并将继续做下去。他们有效地抵制并与统治者讨价还价，限制了他们征用资源的能力。</p>

This became the predominant political feature of all leading industrial countries because voters were in a weak position to effectively control the government in their role as customers for the service of protection.

            <p>民族主义也可以这样说，它成为大众民主的必然结果。能够运用民族主义的国家发现，他们能够以较小的代价动员更大的军队。民族主义是一项发明，它使一个国家能够扩大它在军事上的有效规模。与政治本身一样，民族主义主要是一种现代发明。正如社会学家何塞普·R·洛贝拉（<em>JOSEP R. LLOBERA</em>）在他关于民族主义兴起的记录丰富的书中所表明的，国家是一个想象中的社区，在很大程度上是作为法国大革命期间动员国家权力的一种方式而出现的。正如他所说：『在现代意义上，民族意识只存在于法国大革命之后，从
                1789 年制宪会议将法国人民等同于法兰西民族的时候开始。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en19" id="text00011.html#ch05en19">19</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Nationalism made it easier to mobilize power and control large numbers of people. Nation-states formed by underlining and emphasizing characteristics that people held in common, particularly spoken language. This facilitated rule without the intervention of intermediaries. It simplified the tasks of bureaucracy. Edicts that need only be promulgated in one language can be dispatched more quickly and with less confusion than those that must be translated into a Babel of tongues. Nationalism, therefore, tended to lower the cost of controlling larger areas. Before nationalism, the early-modern state required the aid of lords, dukes, earls, bishops, free cities, and other corporate and ethnic intermediaries, from tax “farmers” to military contract merchants and mercenaries to collect revenues, raise troops and conduct other government functions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>民族主义使调动权力和控制大量人口变得更加容易。领土国家是通过强调人们的共同特征，特别是口语来形成的。这有利于在没有中间人干预的情况下进行统治。它简化了官僚机构的任务。与那些必须翻译成各种语言的法令相比，只需要用一种语言颁布的法令可以更快、更少的混乱地发出。因此，民族主义倾向于降低控制较大地区的成本。在民族主义之前，早期现代国家需要领主、公爵、伯爵、主教、自由城市以及其他企业和民族中介的帮助，从收税代理到军事合同商和雇佣兵，以获取收入、养兵和执行其他政府职能。</p>

            <!-- <p>Nationalism also decisively lowered the costs of mobilizing military personnel by encouraging group identification with the interests of the state. There was such a substantial advantage in harnessing group feeling to the interests of the state that most states, even the allegedly internationalist Soviet Union, converged on nationalism as a complementary ideology.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>民族主义还通过鼓励团体对国家利益的认同，决定性地降低了动员军事人员的成本。在利用群体情感为国家利益服务方面有如此大的优势，以至于大多数国家，甚至是所谓的国际主义的苏联，都将民族主义作为一种补充意识形态。</p>

            <!-- <p>Seen in a longer perspective, nationalism is as much an anomaly as the state itself. As historian William McNeill has documented, polyethnic sovereignties were the norm in the past.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en20" id="text00011.html#ch05en20">20</a></sup>In McNeill’s words, “The idea that a government rightfully should rule only over citizens of a single ethnos started to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en21" id="text00011.html#ch05en21">21</a></sup>An early nationalist entity was the Prussian League (Preussicher Bund), which formed in 1440 in opposition to rule by the Teutonic Order. Some of the characteristics of the order were highlighted earlier as a polar example of a sovereignty unlike the nation-state. The Teutonic Order was a kind of chartered company almost none of whose members were native to Prussia. Its headquarters shifted at various times from Bremen and Lübeck to Jerusalem to Acre to Venice and on to Marienberg on the Vistula. At one time it ruled the district of Burzenland in Transylvania. It is not surprising that a sovereignty so unlike a state would became the object of one of the early attempts to mobilize national feeling as a factor in organizing power. However, as an indication of how different early nationalism was from later varieties, the German-speaking nobles of the Prussian League petitioned the king of Poland to place Prussia under Polish rule, largely because even then the Polish king was a relatively weak monarch who was not expected to rule with the same rigor as the Teutonic Order.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从更长远的角度来看，民族主义与领土国家本身一样是一种反常现象。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en20" id="text00011.html#ch05en20">20</a></sup>用麦克尼尔的话说，『一个政府理应只统治一个民族的公民的想法，在中世纪末期开始在西欧发展。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en21" id="text00011.html#ch05en21">21</a></sup>一个早期的民族主义实体是普鲁士联盟（<em>Preussicher Bund</em>），它于
                1440 年成立，反对条顿骑士团的统治。前面已经强调了该教团的一些特点，作为与领土国家不同的主权的一个极好的例子。条顿骑士团是一种特许公司，其成员几乎没有一个是普鲁士本地人。它的总部在不同时期从不来梅和吕贝克转移到耶路撒冷、阿克里和威尼斯，再转移到维斯瓦河畔的马里恩贝格。它曾一度统治着特兰西瓦尼亚的布尔岑兰地区。一个与国家如此不同的主权国家会成为动员民族感情作为组织权力的一个早期尝试的对象，这并不令人惊讶。然而，为了说明早期的民族主义与后来的民族主义有多么不同，普鲁士联盟的德语贵族向波兰国王请愿，要求将普鲁士置于波兰的统治之下，这主要是因为即使在当时，波兰国王也是一个相对软弱的君主，人们不期望他像条顿骑士团那样严格地进行统治。</p>

            <!-- <p>Nationalism, in its early incarnations, came into play just prior to the Gunpowder Revolution. It continued to develop as the early-modern state developed, taking a quantum leap in importance at the time of the French Revolution. We believe that nationalism as an idea of force has already begun to recede. It probably reached its heyday with Woodrow Wilson’s attempt to endow every ethnic group in Europe with its own state at the close of World War I. It is now a reactionary force, inflamed in places with falling incomes and declining prospects like Serbia.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>民族主义的早期化身，在火药革命之前就开始发挥作用了。它随着早期现代国家的发展而继续发展，在法国大革命时的重要性有了质的飞跃。我们认为，民族主义作为一种力量的思想已经开始消退了。它可能随着伍德罗·威尔逊在第一次世界大战结束时试图赋予欧洲每个民族以自己的国家而达到全盛时期。它现在是一种反动的力量，在像塞尔维亚这样收入下降和前景下降的地方被煽动起来。</p>

            <!-- <p>As we explore later, we expect nationalism to be a major rallying theme of persons with low skills nostalgic for compulsion as the welfare state collapses in the Western democracies. You haven’t seen anything yet. For most persons in the West the fallout from the death of Communism has seemed relatively benign. You have seen a drop in military spending, a plunge in aluminum prices, and a new source of hockey players for the NHL. That is the good news.

The few who have thought about it tend to see it as just another power grab of the kind that has become depressingly familiar in the history of Latin America. But we see it as perhaps the first step toward delegitimizing a form of governance whose immediate megapolitical reason for being has begun to disappear with the transition to the Information Age.

            <!-- <p>In a sense, Peru was no longer a modern nation-state in 1993. It still had a flag and an army, but most of its institutions lay in ruins. Even the prisons had been taken over by the inmates. This disintegration could be traced to a number of causes, but most expert attempts to explain it miss the real point. Peru was an early casualty of the technological change that is making closed economies dysfunctional and undermining central authority everywhere. These megapolitical stresses are compounded because decision-making institutions like the Peruvian congress are trapped by perverse incentives into aggravating the very problems that they most need to solve.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从某种意义上说，秘鲁在 1993 年已不再是一个现代领土国家。它仍然有一面旗帜和一支军队，但它的大多数机构都成了废墟。甚至监狱也被囚犯们接管了。这种解体可以追溯到一些原因，但大多数专家试图解释它，却忽略了真正的问题。秘鲁是技术变革的早期牺牲品，这种变革正在使封闭的经济失去功能，并破坏各地的中央权力。这些巨大的政治压力变得更加复杂，因为像秘鲁国会这样的决策机构受困于不正当的激励，使他们最需要解决的问题变得更加严重。</p>

            <!-- <p>Representative democracy in Peru was like a pair of loaded dice. As a decision mechanism for aggrandizing the state, it was unsurpassed. But when new circumstances called for devolving power, the inherent biases that made democracy so useful under the old megapolitical conditions made it increasingly dysfunctional. The very laws passed by the congress were rapidly destroying any foundation of value or respect for the law. As de Soto put it in <em>The Other Path,</em>“Small interest groups fight among themselves, cause bankruptcies, implicate public officials. Governments hand out privileges. The law is used to give and take away far more than morality permits.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch05-en23" id="text00011.html#ch05en23">23</a></sup>A congress like that in Peru, entirely in thrall to special-interest groups, has all the moral stature of a gang of fences auctioning off stolen goods.

He had also managed to fire fifty thousand government employees, and to trim some subsidies. He had made a start toward balancing the budget. His program of reform included comprehensive plans to create free markets and privatize industry. But as in the former Soviet Union, most of the important elements of Fujimori’s reform were yet to be adopted in 1993, including the first round of large-scale privatization of state banks, mining companies, and utilities. Instead of enacting these necessary proposals, Peru’s congress, like the Russian congress that challenged Yeltsin’s reforms in Moscow, sought to move backwards.

While North Americans carried on as if Peru’s congress were the incarnation of freedom and civilization, the Peruvian people cheered. President Fujimori’s popularity shot up above 70 percent when he sent the congress home. And he was later reelected to a second term in a landslide.

They idled machines, turned off the assembly lines, and made themselves at home. Workers who had been employed to operate the factories sat down in an industrial confrontation that was to last for many weeks. It was a drama punctuated by violent riots and the fluctuating allegiances of the police, the Michigan militia, and political figures at all levels of government. Seeing little progress in forcing their demands, the union struck again on February 1, 1937. Union activists forcibly took over GM’s Chevrolet factory in Flint. By occupying and closing General Motors’ key factories, the workers effectively paralyzed the company’s productive capacity. In the ten days following the seizure of the third plant, GM produced only 153 automobiles in the United States.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <h2>敲诈和保护</h2>

            <!-- <p>Throughout history, violence has been a dagger pointed at the heart of the economy. As Thomas Schelling shrewdly put it, “The power to hurt—to destroy things that somebody treasures, to inflict pain and grief—is a kind of bargaining power, not easy to use but used often. In the underworld it is the basis for blackmail, extortion, and kidnapping, in the commercial world, for boycotts, strikes, and lockouts.… It is often the basis for discipline, civilian and military; and gods use it to exact discipline.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en3" id="text00012.html#ch06en3">3</a></sup>A government’s capacity to tax ultimately depends upon the same vulnerabilities as do private shakedowns and extortion. Although we tend not to perceive it in these terms, the proportion of assets that are controlled and spent coercively, through crime and government, provides a rough measure of the megapolitical balance between extortion and protection. If technology made the protection of assets difficult, crime would tend to be widespread, and so would union activity. Under such circumstances, protection by government would therefore command a premium. Taxes would be high. Where taxes are lower and wage rates in the workplace are determined by market forces rather than through political intervention or coercion, technology has tipped the balance toward protection.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>纵观历史，暴力一直是指向经济中心的一把匕首。正如托马斯·谢林（<em>Thomas Schelling</em>）精明地指出的那样：『伤害的力量 —— 破坏别人珍视的东西，造成痛苦和悲伤 —— 是一种讨价还价的力量，不容易使用，但经常使用。在黑社会，它是敲诈、勒索和绑架的基础，在商业世界，它是抵制、罢工和停工的基础…… 它往往是纪律的基础，无论是民事还是军事；神明用它来执行纪律。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en3" id="text00012.html#ch06en3">3</a></sup>一个政府的税收能力最终取决于与私人勒索和敲诈一样的脆弱性。尽管我们往往不会从这些方面来认识它，但通过犯罪和政府来控制和强制使用的资产比例，提供了敲诈和保护之间跨政治平衡的粗略衡量。如果技术使资产的保护变得困难，犯罪将趋于广泛，工会活动也将如此。在这种情况下，政府的保护就会产生溢价。税收会很高。在税收较低的地方，工作场所的工资率由市场力量决定，而不是通过政治干预或胁迫，技术使天平向保护倾斜。</p>

            <!-- <p>The technological imbalance between extortion and protection reached an extreme at the end of the third quarter of the twentieth century. In some advanced Western societies more than a majority of resources were commandeered by governments. The incomes of a large fraction of the population were either set by fiat or determined under the influence of coercion, such as by strikes and threats of violence in other forms. The welfare state and the trade union were both artifacts of technology, sharing the spoils of the triumph of power over efficiency in the twentieth century. They could not have existed if not for the technologies, military and civilian, that raised the returns to violence during the Industrial Age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>敲诈和保护之间的技术失衡在二十世纪第三季度末达到了一个极端。在一些先进的西方社会中，超过大多数的资源被政府征用了。很大一部分人口的收入要么是由法律规定的，要么是在胁迫的影响下决定的，比如说罢工和其他形式的暴力威胁。福利国家和工会都是技术的产物，在二十世纪分享了权力战胜效率的战利品。如果不是因为工业时代的军事和民用技术提高了暴力的回报率，它们是不可能存在的。</p>

            <!-- <p>The capacity to create assets has always entailed some vulnerability to extortion. The greater the assets created or possessed, the higher the price to be paid, in one way or another. Either you paid off everyone who gained the leverage to employ violence for extortion, or you paid for military power capable of defeating any shakedown attempt by brute force.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <h3>保护的数学</h3>

            <!-- <p>Now the dagger of violence could soon be blunted. Information technology promises to alter dramatically the balance between protection and extortion, making protection of assets in many cases much easier, and extortion more difficult. The technology of the Information Age makes it possible to create assets that are outside the reach of many forms of coercion. This new asymmetry between protection and extortion rests upon a fundamental truth of mathematics. It is easier to multiply than to divide. As basic as this truth is, however, its far-reaching consequences were disguised prior to the advent of microprocessors. High-speed computers have facilitated many billions of times more computations in the past decade than were undertaken in all the previous history of the world. This leap in computation has allowed us for the first time to fathom some of the universal characteristics of complexity. What the computers show is that complex systems can be built and understood only from the bottom up. Multiplying prime numbers is simple. But disaggregating complexity by trying to decompose the product of large prime numbers is all but impossible. Kevin Kelly, editor of <em>Wired,</em>puts it this way: “To multiply several prime numbers into a larger product is easy; any elementary school kid can do it. But the world’s supercomputers choke while trying to unravel a product into its simple primes.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en4" id="text00012.html#ch06en4">4</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>现在，暴力的匕首可能很快就会被钝化。信息技术有望极大地改变保护和敲诈之间的平衡，在许多情况下使资产保护更容易，而敲诈则更困难。信息时代的技术使我们有可能创造出许多形式的胁迫所不能及的资产。这种保护和敲诈之间的新的不对称性建立在数学的一个基本真理之上。乘法比除法更容易。然而，尽管这一真理很基本，但在微处理器出现之前，其深远的后果被掩盖了。在过去十年中，高速计算机促进了数十亿倍的计算，比世界上所有历史上的计算都要多。计算方面的这一飞跃使我们第一次能够摸清复杂性的一些普遍特征。计算机所显示的是，复杂的系统只有从下往上才能被建立和理解。素数相乘很简单。但是，通过试图分解大质数的乘积来分解复杂性是完全不可能的。《连线》杂志的编辑凯文·凯利（<em>Kevin Kelly</em>）是这样说的。『将几个质数乘以一个更大的乘积很容易；任何小学生都能做到。但是，世界上的超级计算机在试图将一个乘积分解成简单的素数时却被噎住了。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en4" id="text00012.html#ch06en4">4</a></sup></p>

As we explore later in this chapter, these algorithms will allow the creation of a new, protected realm of cybercommerce in which the leverage of violence will be greatly reduced. The balance between extortion and protection will tip dramatically in the direction of protection. This will facilitate the emergence of an economy that depends more upon spontaneous adaptive mechanisms and less upon conscious decision-making and resource allocation through bureaucracy. The new system in which protection will be at the forefront will be very different from that which arose from the predominance of compulsion in the industrial period.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>网络经济将不可避免地被这个深刻的数学真理所塑造。它已经在强大的加密算法中得到了明显的体现。正如我们在本章后面所探讨的那样，这些算法将允许创建一个新的、受保护的网络商务领域，其中暴力的杠杆作用将被大大降低。敲诈和保护之间的平衡将向保护的方向大幅倾斜。这将促进经济的出现，它更多地依赖于自发的适应机制，而较少地依赖于有意识的决策和通过官僚机构的资源分配。以保护为主导的新体系将与工业时期强制力占主导地位而产生的体系截然不同。</p>

In a sense, this is not even a choice but an inevitability if the economy is to advance beyond the inflexible central-control stage of development. Such a system, which depends upon linear relationships, is fundamentally primitive. Government appropriation inevitably dragoons resources from high-value complex uses to low-value primitive uses.

Dividing the spoils can never be anything but primitive.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Leave rainwater alone in a low spot and it will grow more complex. Advanced systems of every variety are complex adaptive systems without an authority in charge. Every complex system in nature, of which the market economy is the most evident social manifestation, depends upon dispersed capabilities.

            <p>在宇宙中的任何地方，你都能看到系统在进化过程中获得更大的复杂性。这在天体物理学中是真实的。在一个水坑中也是如此。让雨水单独留在低洼处，它就会变得更加复杂。 每种类型的先进系统都是复杂的适应性系统，没有一个主管部门。自然界中的每一个复杂系统，其中市场经济是最明显的社会表现，都取决于分散的能力。在最广泛的条件下最有效地工作的系统，其复原力取决于适应新的可能性的自发秩序。生命本身就是这样一个复杂的系统。数以亿计的潜在基因组合产生了一个人类个体。对它们进行分类会使任何官僚机构感到困惑。</p>

            <!-- <p>Twenty-five years ago, that could only have been an intuition. Today it is demonstrable. The closer computers bring us to understanding the mathematics of artificial life, the better we understand the mathematics of real life, which are those of biological complexity. These secrets of complexity, harnessed through information technology, are allowing economies to be reconfigured into more complex forms. The Internet and the World Wide Web have already taken on characteristics of an organic system, as Kevin Kelly suggests in <em>Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World.</em><sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en5" id="text00012.html#ch06en5">5</a></sup>In his words, nature is “an idea factory. Vital, postindustrial paradigms are hidden in every jungly ant hill.… The wholesale transfer of bio-logic into machines should fill us with awe.

            <p>二十五年前，这只能是一种直觉。今天，它是可以证明的。计算机让我们越是接近了解人工生命的数学，我们就越是了解真实生命的数学，也就是那些生物的复杂性。这些复杂性的秘密，通过信息技术的驾驭，正允许经济被重新配置成更复杂的形式。互联网和万维网已经具备了有机系统的特征，正如凯文·凯利在《失控》中所说。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en5" id="text00012.html#ch06en5">5</a></sup>用他的话说，『大自然是「一个思想工厂」。重要的、后工业化的范式隐藏在每一个丛林或者荒野之中……

            <!-- <p>Indeed, the consequences of the “wholesale transfer of bio-logic into machines” are bound to be far-reaching. There has always been a strong tendency for social systems to mimic the characteristics of prevailing technology. This is something that Marx got right. Gigantic factories coincided with the age of big government. Microprocessing is miniaturizing institutions. If our analysis is correct, the technology of the Information Age will ultimately create an economy better suited to exploit the advantages of complexity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>的确，『将生物逻辑全盘转入机器』的后果必然是深远的。社会系统总是有一种强烈的趋势，即模仿现行技术的特点。这一点，马克思说得很对。巨大的工厂与大政府的时代相吻合。微处理器技术正在使机构小型化。如果我们的分析是正确的，信息时代的技术将最终创造一个更适合利用复杂性优势的经济。</p>

            <!-- <p>Yet the megapolitical dimensions of such a change are so little understood that even most of those who have recognized its mathematical importance have done so in an anachronistic way. It is simply difficult to grasp and internalize fully the likelihood that technological change in the next few years will antiquate most of the political forms and concepts of the modern world. For example, the late physicist Heinz Pagels wrote in his farseeing book, <em>The Dreams of Reason,</em>“I am convinced that the nations and people who master the new science of Complexity will become the economic, cultural, and political superpowers of the next century.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en7" id="text00012.html#ch06en7">7</a></sup>It is an impressive forecast. But we believe it is bound to be wrong, not because it is misperceived, but precisely because it will prove more right than Dr. Pagels dared to express. Societies that reconfigure themselves to become more complex adaptive systems will indeed prosper. But when they do, they are unlikely to be nations, much less “political superpowers.” The more likely immediate beneficiaries of increased complexity of social systems will be the Sovereign Individuals of the new millennium.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，人们对这种变化的跨政治层面了解甚少，甚至大多数认识到其数学重要性的人也是以一种不合时宜的方式进行的。要完全掌握和内化未来几年的技术变革将使现代世界的大多数政治形式和概念过时的可能性，简直是难上加难。例如，已故物理学家海因茨·帕格斯（<em>Heinz Pagels</em>）在他高瞻远瞩的书《理性的梦想》（<em>The Dreams of Reason</em>）中写道：『我相信，掌握新的复杂性科学的国家和人民将成为下个世纪的经济、文化和政治超级大国。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en7" id="text00012.html#ch06en7">7</a></sup>这是个令人瞩目的预测。但我们认为它必然是错误的，不是因为它被误解了，而恰恰是因为它将被证明比帕格斯博士敢于表达的更正确。将自己重新配置成更复杂的适应性系统的社会确实会繁荣。但当他们这样做时，他们不太可能成为国家，更不可能成为『政治超级大国』。更有可能成为社会系统复杂性增加的直接受益者的，将是新千年的主权个体。</p>

            <!-- <p>As Pagels’s forecast stands, it is the equivalent to a shaman of a hunting band of five hundred generations ago telling his men as they crouched around the campfire, “I am convinced that the first hunting band to master the new science of irrigated planting will have more free time for storytelling than even those guys over at the lake who catch the big fish.” As right as he was about the importance of complexity, Pagels overlooked the most basic fact of all. When the logic of violence changes, society changes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>就帕格尔斯的预测而言，它相当于 500 年前一个狩猎队的萨满在他们蹲在篝火旁时告诉他的手下：『我相信，第一个掌握灌溉种植新科学的狩猎队将有更多的空闲时间来讲故事，甚至比湖边那些钓到大鱼的人还多。』 尽管他对复杂性的重要性的看法是正确的，但帕格斯忽略了一个最基本的事实。当暴力的逻辑发生变化时，社会也会发生变化。</p>

These are issues that were explored by historian Frederic C. Lane, whose work on violence and the economic meaning of war is discussed elsewhere in this volume. When Lane wrote in the middle of this century, the Information Society was nowhere in sight. Under the circumstances, he may well have supposed that the competition to employ violence in the world had reached its final stage with the appearance of the nation-state. There is no hint in his works that he anticipated microprocessing or believed that it was technologically feasible to create assets in cyberspace, a realm without physical existence. Lane had nothing to say about the implications of the possibility that large amounts of commerce could be made all but immune from the leverage of violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>为了了解如何以及为什么，有必要关注很少被提请注意的跨政治的几个方面。这些问题是由历史学家弗雷德里克·C·莱恩（Frederic C. Lane）探讨的，他关于暴力和战争的经济意义的工作在本卷其他地方讨论过。当莱恩在本世纪中期写作时，信息社会还遥遥无期。在这种情况下，他很可能认为，随着领土国家的出现，世界上使用暴力的竞争已经达到最后阶段。在他的作品中，没有任何迹象表明他预见到了微处理器，或者认为在网络空间，一个没有物理存在的领域创造资产在技术上是可行的。莱恩对大量的商业活动可以不受暴力影响的可能性的影响无话可说。</p>

            <!-- <p>While Lane did not foresee the technological revolutions now unfolding, his insights into the various stages of the monopolization of violence in the past were so lucid that they have obvious application to the emerging Information Revolution. Lane’s study of the violent medieval world attracted his attention to issues that conventional economists and historians have tended to neglect. He saw that how violence is organized and controlled plays a large role in determining “what uses are made of scarce resources.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en8" id="text00012.html#ch06en8">8</a></sup>Lane also recognized that while production of violence is not usually considered part of economic output, the control of violence is crucial to the economy.

            <h3>一个时代的结束</h3>

            <!-- <p>As we write, the megapolitical consequences of the Information Age are only beginning to be felt. The economic change of recent decades has been from the primacy of manufactures to that of information and computation, from machine power to microprocessing, from factory to workstation, from mass production to small teams, or even to persons working alone. As the scale of enterprise falls, so does the potential for sabotage and blackmail in the workplace. Smaller-scale operations are much more difficult to organize by unions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在我们写作的时候，信息时代的跨政治后果才刚刚开始被感受到。最近几十年的经济变化是从制造业的首要地位到信息和计算的首要地位，从机器动力到微处理器，从工厂到工作站，从大规模生产到小团队，甚至到个人单独工作。随着企业规模的缩小，工作场所中的破坏和勒索的可能性也在降低。规模较小的企业更难被工会组织起来。</p>

            <!-- <p>Microtechnology allows firms to be smaller, more footloose targets. Many deal in services or products with negligible natural-resource content. In principle, these businesses could be conducted almost anywhere on the planet. They are not trapped at a specific location, like a mine or a port. Therefore, in the fullness of time, they will be far less susceptible to being taxed, either by unions or by politicians. An old Chinese folk wisdom holds, “Of all the thirty-six ways to get out of trouble, the best way is—leave.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en10" id="text00012.html#ch06en10">10</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>微技术使企业能够成为更小、更自由的目标。许多企业经营的服务或产品的自然资源含量可以忽略不计。原则上，这些业务几乎可以在地球上的任何地方进行。它们并不被困在一个特定的地点，如一个矿场或港口。因此，随着时间的推移，它们将更不容易被工会或政治家征税。一个古老的中国民间智慧认为，『三十六计走为上。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en10" id="text00012.html#ch06en10">10</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>In the Information Age, that Oriental wisdom will be easily applied. If operations become uncomfortable due to excessive demands in one location, it will be far easier to move. Indeed, as we explore below, it will be possible in the Information Age to create virtual corporations whose domicile in any jurisdiction will be entirely contingent on the spot market. An overnight increase in the degree of attempted extortion, either by governments or others, could lead to the activities and assets of the virtual corporation fleeing the jurisdiction at the speed of light.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在信息时代，这种东方智慧将很容易被应用。如果在一个地方因要求过高而使业务变得不舒服，那么搬家就会容易得多。事实上，正如我们在下文中所探讨的那样，在信息时代将有可能创建虚拟公司，其在任何司法管辖区的住所将完全取决于现货市场。政府或其他方面的勒索程度一夜之间增加，可能导致虚拟公司的活动和资产以光速退出管辖区。</p>

            <!-- <p>The growing integration of microtechnology into industrial processes means that even those firms that still deal in manufactured products with great economies of scale are no longer as vulnerable to the leverage of violence as they once were. An example illustrating this point is the collapse of the United Auto Workers union’s lengthy strike against Caterpillar, which was called off in the waning days of 1995 after almost two years. Unlike the assembly lines of the 1930s, today’s Caterpillar plant employs far more skilled workers. Pressed by foreign competition, Caterpillar farmed out much of its low-skill work, closed inefficient plants, and spent almost $2 billion computerizing machine tools and installing assembly robots. Even the strike itself helped spur labor-saving efficiencies. The company now claims to need two thousand fewer employees than when the walkout began.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en11" id="text00012.html#ch06en11">11</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>微技术与工业流程的日益融合意味着，即使是那些仍在经营具有巨大规模经济的制成品的公司，也不再像以前那样容易受到暴力杠杆的影响。说明这一点的一个例子是联合汽车工人工会对卡特彼勒公司的长期罢工的崩溃，该罢工在将近两年后于 1995 年的最后几天被取消。与二十世纪 30 年代的装配线不同，今天的卡特彼勒工厂雇用的技术工人要多得多。在外国竞争的压力下，卡特彼勒将许多低技能的工作外包出去，关闭了效率低下的工厂，并花费近 20 亿美元将机床电脑化和安装组装机器人。甚至罢工本身也有助于促进节省劳动力的效率。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en11" id="text00012.html#ch06en11">11</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The megapolitics of the production process has altered more drastically than most people realize.

            <h2>工人对资本家的剥削</h2>

            <!-- <p>The character of technology through most of the twentieth century made the forcible seizure of a factory, or a sit-down, strike, a hard tactic for owners or managers to counter. As historian Robert S. McElvaine put it, a sit-down strike “made it difficult for employers to break the strike without doing the same to their own equipment.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en12" id="text00012.html#ch06en12">12</a></sup>In effect, the workers physically held the owners’ capital to ransom. For reasons we explore below, larger industrial companies proved easier targets for unions to exploit than smaller firms. In 1937, General Motors was perhaps the leading industrial corporation in the world. Its factories were among the largest and most costly aggregations of machinery ever assembled, employing many thousands of workers. Every hour, every day that the GM plants were forced to sit idle cost the company a small fortune. A strike that remained unsettled for weeks, like that in the winter of 1936-37, meant rapidly ballooning losses.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在二十世纪的大部分时间里，技术的特点使得强行夺取工厂或静坐、罢工成为业主或经理们难以对付的策略。正如历史学家 Robert S. McElvaine 所说，静坐罢工『使雇主很难在不对自己的设备采取同样措施的情况下破坏罢工。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en12" id="text00012.html#ch06en12">12</a></sup>实际上，这相当于是工人在身体上对业主的资本进行赎买。由于我们在下面探讨的原因，大型工业公司被证明比小型公司更容易被工会利用。1937
                年，通用汽车公司可能是世界上领先的工业公司。它的工厂是有史以来最大和最昂贵的机械集合体，雇用了成千上万的工人。通用汽车工厂被迫闲置的每一小时、每一天都会给公司带来一大笔损失。像 1936 年至 1937 年冬季那样，持续数周的罢工未得到解决，意味着损失迅速膨胀。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Defying Supply and Demand</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>违背供求关系</h3>

            <!-- <p>Unable to produce automobiles after the seizure of its third plant, GM soon capitulated to the union. This was hardly an economic decision based upon the supply and demand for labor. Far from it. When General Motors acceded to the union demands there were nine million persons unemployed in the United States, 14 percent of the workforce. Most of those without work would gladly have taken jobs at GM. They certainly had the skills to fill assembly-line jobs, although you might not know this from most contemporary accounts. A delicate etiquette shrouded straightforward analysis of labor relations during the industrial period. One of its pretenses was the idea that factory jobs, particularly in the middle of the twentieth century, were skilled work. This was untrue. Most factory jobs could have been performed by almost anyone capable of showing up on time. They required little or no training, not even the ability to read or write. As recently as the 1980s, large fractions of the General Motors workforce were either illiterate, innumerate, or both. Until the 1990s, the typical assembly-line worker at GM received only one day of orientation before taking his place on the assembly line. A job you can learn in a single day is not skilled work.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在第三家工厂被查封后，通用汽车无法生产汽车，很快就向工会屈服了。这几乎不是一个基于劳动力供需关系的经济决定 —— 远非如此。当通用汽车同意工会的要求时，美国有九百万人失业，占劳动力的 14%。大多数没有工作的人都很乐意在通用汽车接受工作。他们当然有填补装配线工作的技能，尽管你可能不会从大多数当代的描述中知道这一点。在工业化时期，一种微妙的礼节笼罩着对劳资关系的直接分析。它的一个借口是认为工厂的工作，特别是在二十世纪中期，是熟练的工作。这是不真实的。大多数工厂的工作几乎可以由任何能够按时出现的人完成。它们几乎不需要培训，甚至不需要读写能力。就在二十世纪八十年代，通用汽车公司的大部分员工要么是文盲，要么是不识字，或者两者都是。直到二十世纪九十年代，通用汽车的典型装配线工人在装配线上就任前只接受了一天的指导。在一天之内就能学会的工作并不是熟练的工作。</p>

            <!-- <p>Yet in 1937, with unskilled and skilled workers alike lined up begging for jobs, GM factory workers were able to coerce their employers into a pay hike. Their success had much more to do with the dynamics of violence than with the supply and demand for labor. In March 1937, the month following the settlement of the GM confrontation, there were 170 more sit-down strikes in the United States. Most were successful. Similar episodes occurred in every industrialized country. The workers simply seized the factories and ransomed them back to the owners. It was a tactic of great simplicity, and one that in most cases was profitable and fun for those participating. One sit-down striker wrote, “I am having a great time, something new, something different, lots of grub and music.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en13" id="text00012.html#ch06en13">13</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而在 1937 年，在非技术工人和技术工人都排队乞讨的情况下，通用汽车工厂的工人却能够胁迫他们的雇主提高工资。他们的成功更多的是与暴力的动力有关，而不是与劳动力的供需有关。1937 年 3 月，也就是通用汽车对峙事件解决后的一个月，美国又发生了 170 次静坐罢工。大多数都是成功的。类似的事件发生在每个工业化国家。工人们简单地夺取了工厂，并将其赎回给业主。这是一种非常简单的策略，而且在大多数情况下，对参与的人来说是有利可图和有趣的。一位静坐罢工者写道：『我过得很愉快，有新的东西，有不同的东西，有很多食物和音乐。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en13" id="text00012.html#ch06en13">13</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The GM sit-down strike of 1936-37 and the other forcible plant seizures of the time were examples of a phenomenon we described in <em>Blood in the Streets</em>as “the exploitation of the capitalists by the workers.” This was not the view that Pete Seeger set to music in his sad songs. But unless you are planning a career as a folk singer in a blue-collar neighborhood the important thing to focus on is not the popular interpretation but the underlying reality. Wherever you look in history there is generally a layer of rationalization and make-believe that disguises the true megapolitical foundations of any systematic extortion. If you take the rationalizations at face value, you are unlikely to grasp what is really going on.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1936-37 年的通用汽车静坐罢工和当时的其他强行夺取工厂的行为是我们在《血流成河》中描述的『工人对资本家的剥削』现象的例子。这并不是皮特·西格在他的悲情歌曲中设定的观点。但是，除非你打算在蓝领社区从事民谣歌手的职业，否则，重要的是要关注的不是流行的解释，而是基本的现实。无论你在哪里看历史，通常都有一层合理化和虚构的东西，掩盖了任何系统性敲诈的真正的跨政治基础。如果你对这些合理化建议照单全收，你就不可能掌握真正发生的情况。</p>

            <h2>解读敲诈的逻辑</h2>

            <!-- <p>To recognize the megapolitical implications of the current shift to the Information Age, you have to strip away the cant and focus on the real logic of violence in society. This is like stripping away the layers of an overripe onion. It may bring tears to your eyes, but don’t look away. We first examine the logic of extortion in the workplace, then extend the analysis to broader issues involving the creation and protection of assets, and the nature of modern government. To a greater degree than most people imagine, the prosperity of government, like that of unions, was directly correlated to the leverage available for extortion. That leverage was much lower in the nineteenth century than in the twentieth. In the next millennium, it will fall almost to the vanishing point.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>要认识到当前向信息时代转变的跨政治影响，你必须剥去伪装，专注于社会中暴力的真正逻辑。这就像剥去一个过熟的洋葱的每一层。它可能会让你泪流满面，但不要看走眼。我们首先研究工作场所的敲诈逻辑，然后将分析扩展到涉及资产的创造和保护以及现代政府的性质等更广泛的问题。在比大多数人想象的更大程度上，政府的繁荣，就像工会的繁荣，与可用于敲诈的杠杆直接相关。这种杠杆作用在十九世纪比在二十世纪要低得多。在下一个千年里，它几乎会下降到消失点。</p>

            <!-- <p>The whole logic of government and the character of power have been transformed by microprocessing. This may seem exaggerated when you first think about it. But look closely. The prosperity of governments has gone hand in hand with the prosperity of labor unions in the twentieth century. Before this century, most governments commandeered far fewer resources than the militant welfare states to which we have become accustomed. Likewise, unions were small or insignificant factors in economic life prior to this century. The ability of workers to coerce their employers into paying above-market wages depended upon the same megapolitical conditions that allowed governments to extract 40 percent or more of the economy's output in taxes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>政府的整个逻辑和权力的特征已经被微处理器所改变。当你第一次思考这个问题时，这可能看起来很夸张。但仔细看看。在二十世纪，政府的繁荣与工会的繁荣并驾齐驱。在本世纪之前，大多数政府征用的资源远远少于我们已经习惯了的激进的福利国家。同样，在本世纪之前，工会在经济生活中也是很小或不重要的因素。工人胁迫其雇主支付高于市场的工资的能力，取决于同样的跨政治条件，这些条件使政府能够在经济产出中提取 40% 或更多的税收。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Workplace Extortion Before the Twentieth Century</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>二十世纪之前的工作场所勒索</h3>

            <!-- <p>The rise and fall of union extortion of the capitalists can be readily explained by the changing megapolitics of the production process. In 1776, when Adam Smith published <em>The Wealth of Nations,</em>conditions for extortion in the workplace were sufficiently unfavorable that “combinations” by workmen “to raise the price of their labour” were seldom tenable. Most manufacturing firms were tiny and family-run. Larger-scale industrial activities were just beginning to emerge. This did not rule out opportunities for violence, but it gave them little leverage. Indeed, during Smith’s time and well into the nineteenth century, unions were generally considered illegal combinations in the Great Britain, the United States, and other common-law countries. Adam Smith described attempted strikes in these terms: “Their usual pretences are sometimes the high price of provisions; sometimes the great profit which their master make by their work.…They have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage.” <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en14" id="text00012.html#ch06en14">14</a></sup>Nonetheless, the workmen “very seldom derive any advantage of those tumultuous combinations,” except “the punishment or ruin of the ringleaders.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en15" id="text00012.html#ch06en15">15</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>工会敲诈资本家的兴衰，可以很容易地用生产过程中不断变化的跨政治来解释。1776 年，当亚当·斯密发表《国富论》时，在工作场所进行敲诈的条件非常不利，工人『提高劳动价格』的『联合』很少能够成立。大多数制造业公司都是小规模和家庭经营的。规模较大的工业活动刚刚开始出现。这并不排除暴力的机会，但它给了他们很少的杠杆作用。事实上，在斯密的时代，直到十九世纪，在英国、美国和其他普通法国家，工会通常被认为是非法组合。亚当·斯密这样描述罢工的企图：『他们通常的借口有时是食品的高价格；有时是他们的主人通过他们的工作获得的巨大利润……
                他们总是诉诸于最大声的喧哗，有时是最令人震惊的暴力和暴行。』 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en14" id="text00012.html#ch06en14">14</a></sup>尽管如此，工人们『很少从这些骚乱的组合中得到任何好处，除了带头人被惩罚或毁掉。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en15" id="text00012.html#ch06en15">15</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Scale economies in industry and firm size grew during the nineteenth century. Yet most individuals continued to work for themselves as farmers or small proprietors, and union organizing efforts, like those described by Adam Smith, continued to “generally end in nothing.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en16" id="text00012.html#ch06en16">16</a></sup>The legal and political standing of unions changed only as the scale of enterprise rose. The first unions that succeeded in organizing were craft unions of highly skilled workers, who normally organized without extensive violence. They tended to settle for wage increases that matched the marginal costs of replacing them. Unions for unskilled workers were another story. They tended to exploit the shift to firms of larger scale by singling out for organizing efforts precisely those industries that were especially vulnerable to coercion, either because they operated at a larger scale or the character of the operations exposed their owners to physical sabotage. This pattern was borne out from Newcastle to Argentina.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en17" id="text00012.html#ch06en17">17</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在十九世纪，工业的规模经济和公司规模不断扩大。然而，大多数人仍然是以农民或小业主的身份为自己工作，而工会组织的努力，就像亚当·斯密所描述的那样，仍然是『通常以失败告终。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en16" id="text00012.html#ch06en16">16</a></sup>工会的法律和政治地位只随着企业规模的扩大而改变。 第一批成功组织起来的工会是由高技术工人组成的手工业工会，他们通常在没有广泛暴力的情况下组织起来。他们倾向于解决工资增长问题，使之与替换他们的边际成本相匹配。非技术工人的工会则是另一种情况。他们倾向于利用向大型企业的转变，专门挑选那些特别容易受到胁迫的行业进行组织，因为这些行业的经营规模较大，或者经营的特点使其所有者面临人身破坏。这种模式从纽卡斯尔到阿根廷都得到了证实。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en17" id="text00012.html#ch06en17">17</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>An early example of violent labor movements in the United States was an attack on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in 1834. Unlike most early-nineteenth-century businesses, the C&amp;O Canal was not a contained and easily protected operation. As originally planned, it was to have stretched 342 miles, with a 3,000-foot rise from the lower Potomac to the upper Ohio.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en18" id="text00012.html#ch06en18">18</a></sup>Digging such a ditch was a big job that never quite got completed. Nonetheless, a large number of workers were employed trying to do it, some of whom were not long in recognizing that the canal could be easily incapacitated. Indeed, without regular maintenance, it could be sabotaged by muskrats burrowing under the towpath. In operation, the canal’s locks and channels could be ruined simply by careless use, floods from heavy rains, or battering by untowed boats. It was a simple matter for strikers to blockade the waterway with sunken boats or other debris. In early 1834, rioting among rival gangs of Irish workers on the C&amp;O led to an attempt to make good this potential and seize the canal. The effort failed, however, leaving five persons dead, after President Andrew Jackson sent federal troops from Ft. McHenry to disperse the workers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>美国暴力劳工运动的一个早期例子是 1834 年对切萨皮克和俄亥俄运河的攻击。与大多数十九世纪早期的企业不同，切萨皮克和俄亥俄运河并不是一个封闭和容易保护的业务。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en18" id="text00012.html#ch06en18">18</a></sup>挖掘这样一条沟渠是一项大工程，从未完全完成。然而，大量的工人被雇用来做这件事，其中一些人不久就认识到运河很容易失去能力。事实上，如果没有定期的维护，它可能会被钻在拖车道下的麝香鼠破坏掉。在运行过程中，运河的水闸和渠道可能会因为不小心使用、大雨造成的洪水或无人驾驶的船只的撞击而毁坏。罢工者用沉船或其他杂物封锁航道是一件很简单的事情。1834
                年初，C&amp;O 上的爱尔兰工人的敌对团伙之间的骚乱导致他们试图发挥这种潜力并夺取运河。然而，在安德鲁·杰克逊总统从麦克亨利堡派出联邦军队驱散工人后，这一努力失败了，造成 5 人死亡。</p>

            <!-- <p>Mines and railroads also offered early targets of choice for union activism in America. Like the C&amp;O Canal, they, too, were highly vulnerable to sabotage. Mines, for example, could be flooded, or blockaded at the entrance. Simply killing the mules that towed the ore cars out of underground mines created a difficult and unpleasant situation for the owners. Likewise, railroad trackbeds stretched over many miles, and could be guarded only with difficulty. It was relatively easy for union thugs to attack mines and railroads and do substantial economic damage. Such attacks became commonplace during attempts to organize effective unions. These efforts were generally most intense during periods when real wages were rising due to deflation. When owners attempted to adjust nominal wages, this often triggered protests leading to violence. Such incidents were widespread in the depression that followed the Panic of 1873.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>矿山和铁路也是美国工会活动的早期选择目标。与 C&amp;O 运河一样，它们也非常容易遭到破坏。例如，矿场可以被淹没，或在入口处被封锁。仅仅杀死将矿车拖出地下矿井的骡子，就会给矿主带来困难和不愉快的局面。同样地，铁路轨床绵延数英里，只能艰难地进行守卫。工会的暴徒比较容易袭击矿场和铁路，并造成巨大的经济损失。在试图组织有效工会的过程中，这种攻击变得很常见。这些努力通常在实际工资因通货紧缩而上升的时期最为激烈。当业主试图调整名义工资时，这往往会引发导致暴力的抗议。这类事件在 1873
                年恐慌之后的大萧条时期十分普遍。

            <!-- <p>In December 1874, open warfare erupted in the anthracite coalfields of eastern Pennsylvania. The unions organized a violent strike force in the guise of a secret society named the Ancient Order of Hibernians. Also known as the “Molly Maguires,” after an Irish revolutionary, this group was known for “terrorizing the coal fields and preventing those miners who wished to work from doing so. Sabotage and destruction of property, outright murder and assassination, were all charged against its members.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en19" id="text00012.html#ch06en19">19</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1874 年 12 月，宾夕法尼亚州东部的无烟煤田爆发了公开战争。工会组织了一支暴力罢工队伍，以一个名为『希伯尼安古会』的秘密社团为掩护。这个团体也被称为『莫利·马奎尔』，取自一位爱尔兰革命家，以『恐吓煤田并阻止那些希望工作的矿工』而闻名。破坏和毁坏财产、公然谋杀和暗杀，都是对其成员的指控。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en19" id="text00012.html#ch06en19">19</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>There was also recurring violence among railroad employees. For example, there were serious outbreaks in July 1877 aimed at destroying the property of both the Pennsylvania and Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroads. Workers took over switches, tore up tracks, sealed off caryards, disabled locomotives, sabotaged, then looted trains, and worse. In Pittsburgh, roundhouses of the Pennsylvania Railroad were set ablaze with hundreds of people inside. Dozens were killed, two thousand railcars were burned and looted and the machine shop was destroyed, along with a grain elevator and 125 locomotives.

            <p>铁路员工中也经常发生暴力事件。例如，1877 年 7 月爆发了严重的暴力事件，旨在破坏宾夕法尼亚州和巴尔的摩以及俄亥俄州铁路的财产。工人们占领了开关，撕毁了铁轨，封锁了货仓，弄坏了机车，破坏了火车，然后抢劫了火车，甚至更糟糕。在匹兹堡，宾夕法尼亚铁路的圆房被放火烧毁，里面有数百人。数十人被杀，两千辆火车车厢被烧毁和抢劫，机械车间被毁，还有一个谷物升降机和 125 台机车。联邦军队进行了干预，以恢复秩序。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en20" id="text00012.html#ch06en20">20</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Although these early strikes were interpreted sympathetically by socialist and union activists, they inspired little public support. Notwithstanding the inherent vulnerability of industries such as mines and railroads, overall megapolitical conditions were not yet favorable to the exploitation of the capitalists by the workers. The scale of enterprise was too small to facilitate systematic extortion. While there were vulnerable industries, they employed too small a fraction of the population to allow the benefits of the coercion against employers to be broadly shared. Without such support, they were unsustainable because owners could depend upon the government for protection. While unions sometimes attempted through intimidation to prevent local officials from enforcing injunctions, these efforts, too, were seldom successful. Even the most violent strikes were usually suppressed within days or weeks by military means.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管这些早期的罢工被社会主义和工会活动家们同情地解释，但他们几乎没有激发公众的支持。尽管矿山和铁路等行业存在固有的脆弱性，但总体的跨政治条件还不利于工人对资本家的剥削。企业的规模太小，不利于进行系统的敲诈。虽然有脆弱的行业，但它们雇用的人口比例太小，无法广泛分享胁迫雇主的好处。如果没有这种支持，这些行业是不可持续的，因为业主可以依赖政府的保护。虽然工会有时试图通过恐吓来阻止地方官员执行禁令，但这些努力也很少成功。即使是最激烈的罢工，通常也会在几天或几周内被军事手段镇压。</p>

            <!-- <p>There is a lesson to be learned for the Information Age in the fact that union attempts to achieve wages above market-clearing levels were seldom successful when firm size was small. Not even those lines of business that were clearly vulnerable to sabotage, such as canals, railways, streetcars, and mines, were easily brought under control. This is not because the unions shrank from using violence. To the contrary. Violence was lavishly employed, sometimes against high-profile individuals. For example, in a case celebrated in the American labor movement as a case of “miners’ vengeance,” Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho, who had opposed an attempt by miners to blockade properties at Coeur d’Alene, was assassinated by a bomb tossed by a contract killer hired by the union.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en21" id="text00012.html#ch06en21">21</a></sup>But even murder and threats of murder were usually insufficient to obtain union recognition prior to the emergence of large-scale factories and mass-production enterprises in the twentieth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在信息时代有一个教训，那就是当公司规模较小时，工会试图使工资高于市场结算水平的努力很少成功。即使是那些明显容易受到破坏的业务领域，如运河、铁路、有轨电车和矿山，也不容易受到控制。这并不是因为工会对使用暴力有所顾忌。恰恰相反。暴力被大量使用，有时是针对高知名度的个人。例如，在美国劳工运动中被誉为『矿工复仇』的一个案例中，爱达荷州州长弗兰克·斯泰纳伯格（<em>Frank Steunenberg</em>）曾反对矿工封锁科德莱恩财产的企图，他被工会雇用的合同杀手扔下的炸弹暗杀。
                <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en21" id="text00012.html#ch06en21">21</a></sup>但是，在二十世纪大规模工厂和大规模生产企业出现之前，即使是谋杀和谋杀威胁通常也不足以获得工会的承认。</p>

            <!-- <p>To understand why the circumstances of unions underwent such a change in the twentieth century, you must look at the characteristics of production technology. Something definitely changed with the rapid rise of blue-collar factory employment in the early decades of the twentieth century. This change made businesses at the forefront of the economy especially vulnerable to extortion. In fact, the physical characteristics of industrial technology almost invited workers to employ coercion to shake down the capitalists. Consider:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>要理解为什么工会的情况在二十世纪发生了这样的变化，你必须看一看生产技术的特点。二十世纪初的几十年里，随着工厂蓝领就业率的迅速上升，肯定会发生一些变化。这种变化使处于经济前沿的企业特别容易受到勒索。事实上，工业技术的物理特性几乎邀请工人采用胁迫手段来撼动资本家的地位。请看：</p>

            <!-- <p>1. <strong>There was a high natural-resource content in most industrial products.</strong>This tended to anchor production to a limited number of locations, almost in the way that mines must be located where the ore bodies are. Factories placed near transportation centers with convenient access to parts suppliers and raw materials had significant operating advantages. This made it easier for coercive organizations, like governments and unions, to extract some of those advantages for themselves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1. <strong>大多数工业产品中都有很高的自然资源含量。</strong>这倾向于将生产固定在有限的地点，几乎就像矿场必须位于矿体的位置一样。靠近交通中心的工厂，可以方便地接触到零部件供应商和原材料，具有明显的经营优势。这使得政府和工会等强制性组织更容易为自己攫取其中的一些优势。</p>

            <!-- <p>2. <strong>Rising economies of scale led to very large enterprises.</strong>Early-nineteenth-century factories had been relatively small. But as scale economies increased with the assembly line during the twentieth century, the size and cost of facilities at the forefront of the production process rose rapidly. This made them easier targets in several ways. For example, significant scale economies tend to go hand in hand with long product cycles. Long product cycles make for more stable markets. This, in turn, invites predatory targeting of firms because it implies that there are longer-term benefits to capture.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>2. <strong>规模经济的上升导致了非常大的企业。</strong>十九世纪初的工厂相对较小。但在二十世纪，随着规模经济的发展，处于生产过程最前沿的设施的规模和成本迅速上升。这使得它们在几个方面更容易成为目标。例如，显著的规模经济往往与长的产品周期相伴而行。长的产品周期使市场更加稳定。这反过来又会招致对企业的掠夺性攻击，因为这意味着有更长期的利益可以获取。</p>

            <!-- <p>3. <strong>The number of competitors in leading industries fell sharply.</strong>It was not uncommon during the industrial period to find only a handful of firms competing for billion-dollar markets. This contributed to making these firms targets for union extortion. It is far simpler to attack five firms than five thousand. The very concentration of industry was itself a factor that facilitated extortion. This advantage was self-reinforcing because the firms coerced into paying monopoly wages were unlikely to face stiff competition from others who were not also burdened by above-market labor costs. Unions could therefore drain a considerable portion of the profits of such firms without exposing them to immediate bankruptcy. Obviously, if employers had routinely gone broke whenever they were forced to pay above-market wages, workers would have gained little by coercing them to do so.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>3. <strong>领先行业的竞争者数量急剧下降。</strong>在工业化时期，只有少数几家公司在竞争十亿美元的市场，这并不罕见。这有助于使这些公司成为工会敲诈的目标。攻击五家公司比攻击五千家公司要简单得多。工业的集中本身就是一个有利于敲诈的因素。这种优势是自我强化的，因为被胁迫支付垄断工资的公司不太可能面临来自其他公司的激烈竞争，而这些公司也没有被高于市场的劳动力成本所困扰。因此，工会可以耗尽这些公司的相当一部分利润，而不会使它们立即破产。显然，如果雇主在被迫支付高于市场水平的工资时经常破产，那么，工人通过强迫他们这样做，就不会有什么收获。</p>

            <!-- <p>4. <strong>The capital requirements for fixed investment rose to match the scale of enterprise.</strong>This not only increased the vulnerability of capital and magnified the costs of plant closures; it also made it increasingly unlikely that a modern factory could be owned by a single individual or family, except through inheritance from someone who had launched the business at a smaller scale. In order to fund the massive costs of tooling and operating a large factory, the wealth of hundreds or thousands of people had to be pooled together in capital markets. This tended to make it more difficult for the splintered and almost anonymous owners to defend their property. They had little choice but to rely upon professional managers who seldom held more than a bare chemical trace of the outstanding shares of the company. Reliance on subordinate managers weakened the resistance of firms to extortion. The managers lacked strong incentives to risk life and limb protecting the property of the firm. Their efforts seldom matched the kind of militancy commonly seen among owners of liquor stores and other small businesses when their property comes under threat.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>4. <strong>固定投资的资本要求上升，以配合企业的规模。</strong>这不仅增加了资本的脆弱性，并放大了工厂关闭的成本；它还使现代工厂越来越不可能由一个人或家庭拥有，除非是通过继承在较小规模上启动业务的人的遗产。为了资助大型工厂的模具制造和运营的巨大成本，成百上千人的财富必须在资本市场上汇集起来。这往往使四分五裂、几乎匿名的业主更难捍卫自己的财产。他们没有什么选择，只能依靠职业经理人，而这些职业经理人持有的股份很少超过公司已发行股份的最低化学含量。对下属经理的依赖削弱了公司对敲诈的抵抗力。经理们缺乏强烈的动机去冒生命危险保护公司的财产。他们的努力很少与酒类商店和其他小企业的业主在其财产受到威胁时常见的那种好斗精神相匹配。</p>

            <!-- <p>5. <strong>Greater firm size also meant that more of the total workforce was employed in fewer firms than at any time in the past.</strong>In some cases, tens of thousands of workers found employment in a single company. In military terms, the owners and managers were starkly outnumbered by persons employed in subordinate positions. Ratios of thirty to one or worse were common. This disadvantage rose with firm size because massive numbers of workers assembled together could more easily employ violence in an anonymous way. Under such conditions, the workers were unlikely to have had any meaningful contact or relationships with the owners of the factory. The anonymous character of these relationships no doubt made it easier for workers to dismiss the importance of the owners’ property rights.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>5. <strong>更大的公司规模也意味着比过去任何时候都更多的总劳动力受雇于更少的公司。</strong>在某些情况下，数万名工人在一家公司找到工作。从军事角度看，业主和经理的人数明显多于受雇于下属职位的人员。三十比一或更差的比例是很常见的。这种劣势随着公司规模的扩大而增加，因为大量的工人聚集在一起，更容易以匿名的方式使用暴力。在这种情况下，工人们不可能与工厂的所有者有任何有意义的接触或关系。这些关系的匿名性无疑使工人更容易忽视业主产权的重要性。</p>

            <!-- <p>6. <strong>Massed employment in a small number of firms was a broad social phenomenon.</strong>This further enhanced the megapolitical advantages enjoyed by unions as compared to the nineteenth century in America, when most people were self-employed or working in small firms. In 1940, 60 percent of the American workforce had blue-collar jobs.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en22" id="text00012.html#ch06en22">22</a></sup>As a consequence, support for the use of extortion to raise wages spread among a large number who imagined they might benefit by it. This was illustrated by a 1938-39 study of the views of 1,700 people in Akron, Ohio, toward corporate property. The survey found that 68 percent of the CIO Rubber Workers had very little or no sympathy with the concept of corporate property, “while only one percent were found in the classification of strong support of corporate property rights.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en23" id="text00012.html#ch06en23">23</a></sup>On the other hand, not a single businessman, even a small proprietor, fell into the same category of “strong opposition to corporate property; 94 percent received ratings in the range of extremely high support for the rights of property.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en24" id="text00012.html#ch06en24">24</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>6. <strong>在少数公司中的大量就业是一种广泛的社会现象。</strong>与十九世纪的美国相比，这进一步增强了工会享有的跨政治优势，当时大多数人都是自营职业者或在小公司工作。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en22" id="text00012.html#ch06en22">22</a></sup>因此，对使用敲诈手段提高工资的支持在大量想象自己可能从中受益的人中蔓延。1938 年至 1939 年对俄亥俄州阿克伦市 1700
                人对公司财产的看法的研究就说明了这一点。调查发现，68% 的 CIO 橡胶工人对公司财产的概念很少或没有同情心，『而只有 1% 的人被发现在强烈支持公司产权的分类中。』 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en23" id="text00012.html#ch06en23">23</a></sup>另一方面，没有一个商人，即使是小业主，也属于『强烈反对公司产权；94% 的人得到的评分在极度支持产权的范围内。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en24" id="text00012.html#ch06en24">24</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>7. <strong>Assembly-line technology was inherently sequential.</strong>The fact that the whole production process depended upon the movement and assembly of parts in a fixed sequence created additional vulnerabilities to disruption. In effect, the assembly line was like a railroad within factory walls. If the track could be blocked, or the availability of a single part could be cut off, the whole production process was brought to a halt.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>7. <strong>装配线技术本质上是有顺序的。</strong>整个生产过程取决于零件按固定顺序的移动和装配，这就造成了更多的破坏性漏洞。实际上，装配线就像工厂围墙内的一条铁路。如果轨道被阻断，或者一个零件的供应被切断，整个生产过程就会停顿下来。</p>

            <!-- <p>8. <strong>Assembly-line technology standardized work.</strong>This reduced the variability of output for persons of different skills working with the same tools. In fact, a crucial objective of factory design was to create a system in which a genius and a moron on successive shifts of the assembly line would produce the same product. What might be called “stupid” machines were designed to be capable of only one kind of output. This made it unnecessary for even the buyer of a Cadillac to inquire about the identity of the line workers who produced his vehicle. All the products were meant to be alike, whatever the differences in skills and intelligence between the workers who produced them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>8. <strong>装配线技术使工作标准化。</strong>这减少了使用相同工具的不同技能人员的产出变化。事实上，工厂设计的一个重要目标是创造一个系统，使装配线上的天才和白痴连续轮班生产相同的产品。被称为『愚蠢』的机器被设计为只能够生产一种产品。这使得即使是凯迪拉克的购买者也没有必要去询问生产他的车辆的生产线工人的身份。所有的产品都是一样的，无论生产这些产品的工人的技能和智力有多大差异。</p>

            <!-- <p>The fact that unskilled workers on the assembly line could produce the same product as more able individuals contributed to the egalitarian agenda by making it appear that everyone’s economic contributions were equal. Entrepreneurial skills and mental effort seemed less important. The magic of modern production appeared to lie in the machines themselves. If they could not actually have been designed by everyone, they nevertheless appeared to be intellectually accessible to almost everyone. This gave more plausibility to the fiction that unskilled labor was being “exploited” by factory owners who could be cut out of the equation with no loss to anyone but themselves. “We learned we can take the plant,” as one GM striker put it. “We already knew how to run them. If General Motors isn’t careful well put two and two together.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en25" id="text00012.html#ch06en25">25</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>装配线上的非熟练工人可以与更有能力的人生产同样的产品，这一事实通过使每个人的经济贡献看起来都是平等的，促进了平等主义的议程。创业技能和精神努力似乎不那么重要。现代生产的魅力似乎在于机器本身。如果它们实际上不可能是由每个人设计的，但它们似乎在智力上几乎可以为每个人所用。这使得非熟练劳动力被工厂主『剥削』的说法更加可信，而工厂主可以将他们从等式中剔除，除了他们自己，没有任何损失。『我们了解到我们可以拿下工厂，』一位通用汽车公司的前线人员如是说。『我们已经知道如何经营它们了。如果通用汽车公司不小心的话，那结果谁都知道。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en25" id="text00012.html#ch06en25">25</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>These characteristics of industrial technology led uniformly to the creation of labor unions to exploit the vulnerability to shakedowns, and to larger governments that fattened on the high taxes that could be imposed upon large-scale industrial facilities. This did not happen once or twice, it happened everywhere large-scale industry took root. Time after time, unions emerged to employ violence to achieve wages considerably above market levels. They were able to do this because industrial factories tended to be expensive, conspicuous, immobile, and costly. They could scarcely be hidden. They could not be moved. Every moment they were out of service meant that their staggering costs were not being amortized.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>工业技术的这些特点统一导致了工会的建立，以利用对摇钱树的脆弱性，也导致了更大的政府因可以对大规模工业设施征收高额税收而发财。这种情况不是一次或两次，它发生在大规模工业扎根的地方。一次又一次，工会出现了，他们使用暴力来实现大大高于市场水平的工资。他们之所以能够做到这一点，是因为工业工厂往往是昂贵的、显眼的、不流动的和昂贵的。它们几乎不可能被隐藏。它们不能被移动。它们停止使用的每一刻都意味着它们惊人的成本没有被摊销。</p>

            <!-- <p>All this made them sitting ducks for coercive shakedowns, a fact that is far more obvious in the history of labor unions than the prevailing ideology of the twentieth century would have you believe. The noted economist Henry Simons framed the issue in 1944:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>所有这些都使他们成为胁迫性敲诈的活靶子，这一事实在工会的历史上远比二十世纪的主流意识形态要明显得多。著名的经济学家亨利·西蒙斯在 1944 年提出了这个问题：</p>

            <blockquote>

                <!-- <p>Labor organization without large powers of coercion and intimidation is an unreal abstraction. Unions now have such powers; they always have had and always will have, so long as they persist in the present form. Where the power is small or insecurely possessed, it must be exercised overtly and extensively; large and unchallenged, it becomes like the power of government, confidently held, respectfully regarded, and rarely displayed conspicuously.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en26" id="text00012.html#ch06en26">26</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>没有强大的胁迫和恐吓能力的劳工组织是一个不真实的抽象概念。工会现在有这样的权力；只要它们以目前的形式坚持下去，它们一直都有，也将一直有。在权力小或不安全的地方，它必须公开和广泛地行使；大而无当，它就会变得像政府的权力一样，自信地持有，受人尊重，而很少显眼地展示。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en26" id="text00012.html#ch06en26">26</a></sup></p>

            </blockquote>

            <!-- <p>As precise as Simons’s analysis is, however, he was wrong about a crucial point. He presumed that unions “always will have” what he described as “large powers of coercion and intimidation.” In fact, unions are fading away, not merely in the United States and Great Britain, but in other mature industrial societies. The reason they are fading, what Simons missed and what even many union organizers fail to understand, is that the shift to an Information Society has altered megapolitical conditions in crucial ways that sharply increase the security of property. Microtechnology has already begun to prove subversive of the extortion that supports the welfare state because even in the commercial realm it creates very different incentives from those of the industrial period.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管西蒙斯的分析很精确，但他在一个关键点上是错误的。他假定工会『将永远拥有』他所说的『巨大的强制和恐吓权力』。事实上，工会正在逐渐消失，不仅仅是在美国和英国，而且在其他成熟的工业社会。他们正在消退的原因，也是西蒙斯所忽略的，甚至是许多工会组织者所不了解的，是向信息社会的转变已经以关键的方式改变了跨政治条件，大大增加了财产的安全性。微观技术已经开始证明对支持福利国家的勒索的颠覆，因为即使在商业领域，它也创造了与工业时期非常不同的激励机制。</p>

            <!-- <p>1. <strong>Information technology has negligible natural-resource content.</strong>It confers few if any inherent advantages of location. Most information technology is highly portable. Because it can function independent of place, information technology increases the mobility of ideas, persons, and capital. General Motors could not pack up its three assembly lines in Flint, Michigan, and fly away. A software company can. The owners can download their algorithms into portable computers and take the next plane out. Such firms also have an added inducement to escape high taxes or union demands for monopoly wages. Smaller firms tend to have more competitors. If you have dozens or even hundreds of competitors tempting your customers, you cannot afford to pay politicians or your employees much more than they are actually worth. If you alone tried to do so, your costs would be higher than your competitors and you would go broke. The absence of significant operating advantages in a given locale means that coercive organizations, like governments and unions, will inevitably have less leverage to exploit in trying to extract some of those advantages for themselves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1. <strong>信息技术的自然资源含量可以忽略不计。</strong>它几乎没有赋予任何固有的位置优势。大多数信息技术都是高度便携的。由于它可以不受地点的限制，信息技术提高了思想、人员和资本的流动性。通用汽车公司不可能把它在密歇根州弗林特的三条装配线打包后飞走。一家软件公司却可以。业主们可以把他们的算法下载到便携式电脑中，然后乘下一班飞机离开。这类公司还有一个额外的诱因，可以逃避高额税收或工会要求的垄断工资。较小的公司往往有更多的竞争对手。如果你有几十个甚至几百个竞争者在诱惑你的客户，你就没有能力向政治家或你的雇员支付比他们实际价值高得多的报酬。如果你一个人试图这样做，你的成本将高于你的竞争对手，你会破产。在一个特定的地方没有明显的经营优势，意味着像政府和工会这样的强制性组织，在试图为自己提取其中的一些优势时，不可避免地会减少可利用的杠杆。</p>

            <!-- <p>2. <strong>Information technology lowers the scale of enterprise.</strong>This makes for smaller firm size, which implies a larger number of competitors. Increased competition reduces the potential for extortion by raising the number of targets that must be physically controlled in order to raise wages or tax rates above competitive levels. The sharp fall in the average size of firms facilitated by information technology has already reduced the number of persons employed in subordinate positions. In the United States, for example, widely reported estimates suggest that as many as 30 million persons worked alone in their own firms in 1996. Obviously, these 30 million are unlikely to go on strike against themselves. It is only slightly less plausible that the additional millions who work in small firms with a handful of employees would attempt to coerce their employers into paying above-market wages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>2. <strong>信息技术降低了企业的规模。</strong>这使得公司规模更小，这意味着有更多的竞争对手。竞争的加剧减少了勒索的可能性，因为它增加了必须实际控制的目标数量，以便将工资或税率提高到竞争水平之上。在信息技术的推动下，公司的平均规模急剧下降，已经减少了受雇于下属职位的人数。例如，在美国，广泛报道的估计表明，1996 年有多达 3000 万人单独在自己的公司工作。显然，这三千万人不可能对自己进行罢工。在只有少数员工的小公司工作的另外几百万人，试图胁迫他们的雇主支付高于市场的工资，这只是稍微不那么合理的说法。</p>

            <!-- <p>In the Information Age, workers who wish to raise their wages through extortion will lack the military advantage of overwhelming numbers that made them more formidable within the factory. The fewer persons employed in any firm, the fewer the opportunities for anonymous violence. For this reason alone, ten thousand workers divided among five hundred firms would pose a lesser threat to the property of those firms than ten thousand workers in a single firm, even if the ratio of workers to owners/managers were exactly the same.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在信息时代，希望通过敲诈来提高工资的工人将缺乏压倒性数量的军事优势，而这种优势使他们在工厂里更加可怕。任何公司雇佣的人数越少，匿名暴力的机会就越少。仅仅因为这个原因，一万名工人分在五百家公司中，对这些公司的财产构成的威胁就会小于一家公司中的一万名工人，即使工人与所有者/管理者的比例完全相同。</p>3.

            <!-- <p>3. <strong>Falling scale in enterprise also implies that efforts to secure above-market wages are less likely to command broad social support, as they did in the industrial period.</strong>Unions seeking to shake down employers are much more likely to find themselves in the situation of the canal workers, railroad employees, and miners of the nineteenth century. Even where a few firms with large-scale economies remain as holdovers from the Industrial Age, they will do so in a context of widely dispersed employment in small firms. The preponderance of small firms and smallholders suggests greater social support for property rights even if the desire to redistribute income remains unaltered.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>3. <strong>企业规模的缩小也意味着争取高于市场工资的努力不太可能得到广泛的社会支持，就像在工业时期那样。</strong>试图撼动雇主的工会更有可能发现自己处于十九世纪的运河工人、铁路雇员和矿工的处境。即使少数拥有大规模经济的公司作为工业时代的遗留物仍然存在，它们也会在小公司广泛分散就业的背景下这样做。小公司和小农户的优势表明，即使重新分配收入的愿望没有改变，社会对产权的支持也更大。</p>

            <!-- <p>4. <strong>Information technology lowers capital costs,</strong>which also tends to increase competition by facilitating entrepreneurship and allowing more people to work independently. Lower capital requirements not only reduce barriers to entry; they also reduce “barriers to exit.” In other words, they imply that firms are likely to have fewer assets relative to income, and therefore less ability to sustain losses. Not only will they tend to have less recourse to banks for borrowing; firms in the Information Age are also likely to have fewer physical assets to capture.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>4. <strong>信息技术降低了资本成本，</strong>这也倾向于通过促进创业和允许更多人独立工作来增加竞争。较低的资本要求不仅减少了进入的障碍；它们也减少了『退出的障碍』。换句话说，它们意味着企业相对于收入而言，可能拥有较少的资产，因此承受损失的能力较弱。他们不仅倾向于减少对银行的借贷，信息时代的公司也可能拥有更少的实物资产来获取。</p>

            <!-- <p>5. <strong>Information technology shortens the product cycle.</strong>This makes for more rapid product obsolescence. This, too, tends to make any gains that might be achieved by extorting above-market wages short-lived. In highly competitive markets, wages that are too high may lead directly to a rapid loss of jobs and even bankruptcy for the firm. Grasping for temporarily higher wages at the expense of placing your job in jeopardy is like burning your furniture to make the house a few degrees warmer.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>5. <strong>信息技术缩短了产品周期。</strong>这使得产品淘汰的速度更快。这也往往会使任何通过敲诈高于市场的工资而获得的收益变得短命。在高度竞争的市场中，过高的工资可能直接导致工作岗位的迅速丧失，甚至导致公司破产。以牺牲自己的工作为代价来争取暂时的高工资，就像烧掉自己的家具来让房子暖和几度一样。</p>

            <!-- <p>6. <strong>Information technology</strong>’ <em>is not sequential but simultaneous and dispersed.</em>Unlike the assembly line, information technology can accommodate multiple processes at the same time. It disperses activities on networks, allowing for redundancy and substitution between workstations that could number in the thousands or even the millions and be anywhere on earth. In increasing numbers of activities, it is possible for people to cooperate without ever coming into physical contact with one another. As virtual reality and video conferencing become more advanced, the trend toward dispersal of functions and telecommuting will accelerate. This is the Information Age equivalent of “putting out,” which broke the power of the medieval guilds.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>6. <strong>信息技术的工作流不是顺序的，而是同时的和分散的。</strong>与流水线不同，信息技术可以同时容纳多个过程。它将活动分散在网络上，允许工作站之间的冗余和替换，这些工作站的数量可能达到数千甚至数百万，并且在地球上的任何地方。在越来越多的活动中，人们有可能在没有物理接触的情况下进行合作。随着虚拟现实和视频会议变得更加先进，职能分散和远程办公的趋势将加速。这相当于信息时代的『放风』，它打破了中世纪行会的权力。</p>

But if the “workplace” does not exist as a central location, and most of the functions are dispersed to subcontractors and telecommuters, there is very little to distinguish from a shakedown racket their efforts to extort money from their clients or “employers.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>越来越少的人将在烟雾缭绕的工厂里一起工作，这一事实不仅剥夺了工人以前在对资本家进行工程敲诈时享有的重要优势；它还使人们甚至越来越难以将工作场所中可以接受的敲诈类型与敲诈行为区分开来。在此之前，只有那些在一个共同的环境中一起工作并受雇于一家公司的人，才被允许使用暴力来试图提高他们的收入。但是，如果『工作场所』不作为一个中心地点存在，而且大部分职能分散在分包商和远程办公人员身上，那么他们从客户或『雇主』那里勒索钱财的努力就很难与敲诈勒索区分开。</p>

            <!-- <p>For example, is a telecommuter who demands extra cash under threat of infecting the company’s computers with a virus a worker on strike? Or an Internet racketeer?</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Of course, it might be suggested that the worker or telecommuter could always report to the office and carry on a more traditional strike there. But even this may not be as simple as it would seem in the Information Age. The capacity of information technology to transcend locality and disperse economic functions means that for the first time employees and employers need not even reside in the same jurisdictions. Here, we are not talking about the difference between being in the boroughs of Mayfair and Peckham, but of employers in Bermuda and telecommuters in New Delhi.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当然，有人可能会建议，工人或远程办公人员可以随时向办公室报告，并在那里进行更传统的罢工。但是，在信息时代，即使是这样，也可能没有想象中那么简单。信息技术超越地域和分散经济功能的能力，意味着雇员和雇主第一次不需要居住在同一管辖区。在这里，我们谈论的不是在梅费尔区和佩克汉姆区的区别，而是在百慕大的雇主和在新德里的远程办公人员。</p>

Chiat/Day, a large advertising company, has already set about dismantling its headquarters. Its employees, or subcontractors, stay in touch through call-forwarding and the Internet. When it becomes necessary to assemble talent teams to coordinate work on account projects, they rent hotel meeting rooms. When the project is over they check out.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>The fact that microprocessing helps to liberate and disperse the production process from the fixed sequence of the assembly line greatly reduces the leverage formerly enjoyed by coercive institutions like unions and governments. If the assembly line were like a railroad within factory walls that could easily be captured by a sit-down strike, cyberspace is an unbounded realm without physical existence. It cannot be occupied by force or held to ransom.

            <p>事实上，微处理器有助于将生产过程从装配线的固定顺序中解放出来并加以分散，这大大降低了工会和政府等强制性机构以前享有的杠杆作用。如果说流水线就像工厂围墙内的铁路，很容易被静止的罢工所占领，那么网络空间则是一个没有物理存在的无界领域。它不能被武力占领或被勒索。在信息时代，希望使用暴力作为杠杆来获取更高的收入的员工，其地位将远远弱于 1936-37 年通用汽车公司的静坐罢工者。</p>

            <!-- <p>7. <strong>Microprocessing individualizes work.</strong>Industrial technology standardized work. Anyone using the same tools would produce the same output. Microtechnology has started replacing “stupid” machines with more intelligent technology capable of highly variable output. The increased variability of output for persons using the same tools has profound implications, many of which we explore in coming chapters. Among the more important is the fact that where output varies, incomes vary as well. Most of the value in fields where skill varies will tend to be created by a small number of persons. This is a common characteristic of the most highly competitive markets. It is quite evident, for example, in sports. Many millions of young people worldwide play various versions of football. But 99 percent of the money that is spent to watch football games is paid to see the performances of a tiny fraction of the total number of players. Likewise, the world is full of aspiring actors and actresses. Yet only a relatively small number become stars. Equally, tens of thousands of books are published annually. But most of the royalty money is paid to a small number of best-selling authors who can really entertain their readers. Unhappily, we are not among them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>7. <strong>微处理器使工作个性化。</strong>工业技术使工作标准化。任何使用相同工具的人都会产生相同的产出。微技术已经开始用更智能的技术取代『愚蠢』的机器，能够实现高度可变的产出。使用相同工具的人，其产出的可变性增加了，这具有深远的影响，我们将在接下来的章节中探讨其中的许多内容。其中比较重要的是，在产出不同的地方，收入也不同。在技能不同的领域，大部分的价值往往是由少数人创造的。这是竞争最激烈的市场的一个共同特征。例如，这在体育领域是非常明显的。全世界有数以百万计的年轻人踢各种版本的足球。但花在观看足球比赛上的
                99% 的钱都是为了看总人数中极小部分球员的表演。同样地，世界上有很多有抱负的演员和女演员。然而，只有相对较少的人成为明星。同样地，每年有数以万计的书籍出版。但大部分版税都付给了少数真正能娱乐读者的畅销书作者。不幸的是，我们并不在其中。</p>

            <!-- <p>The vast variability of output among persons employing the same equipment poses yet another obstacle to extortion. It creates a major bargaining problem about how to share the payoff. Where a relatively small proportion of those participating in a given activity create most of the value, it is all but mathematically impossible for them to be left better off by a coerced outcome that averages incomes. One software programmer may devise an algorithm for controlling a robot that proves to be worth millions. Another, working with identical equipment, may write a program worth nothing. The more productive programmer is no more likely to wish to have his income tied to that of his compatriot than Tom Clancy is to agree to average his book royalties with ours.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>采用相同设备的人之间产出的巨大差异给敲诈带来了另一个障碍。它造成了一个关于如何分享回报的重大谈判问题。当参与某项活动的人中相对较少的一部分人创造了大部分价值时，从数学上讲，他们不可能因为平均收入的胁迫结果而得到更好的回报。一个软件程序员可能设计出一种控制机器人的算法，而这种算法被证明是价值数百万的。另一个人在使用相同的设备时，可能写出一个毫无价值的程序。生产力更强的程序员不可能希望他的收入与他的同胞的收入挂钩，而汤姆·克兰西也不可能同意将他的图书版税与我们的版税平均。</p>

            <!-- <p>Even the early stages of the Information Revolution have made it far more obvious than it was in 1975 that skills and mental ability are crucial variables in economic output. This has already vaporized the once-proud rationalization for extortion of the capitalists by the workers that prevailed during the industrial period. The fantasy that unskilled labor actually created the value that seemed to be pocketed in a disproportionate share by the capitalists and entrepreneurs is already an anachronism. It is not even a plausible fiction in the case of information technology. When the programmer sits down to write code, there is too direct a line of attribution between his skill and his product to allow for much mistake about who is responsible. It is obvious beyond dispute that an illiterate or semi-literate could not program a computer. It is therefore equally obvious that any value in programs compiled by others could not have been stolen from him. This is why cries of “exploitation” by workers are now heard mainly among janitors.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>即使在信息革命的早期阶段，技能和心智能力是经济产出的关键变量，这一点也比 1975 年时更为明显。这已经使工业时期盛行的工人敲诈资本家的曾经的合理性蒸发了。幻想非技术工人实际上创造了似乎被资本家和企业家不成比例地收入囊中的价值，这已经是一个不合时宜的说法。就信息技术而言，它甚至不是一个可信的虚构。当程序员坐下来写代码时，他的技能和他的产品之间的归属关系太直接了，不允许对谁负责有什么错误。很明显，一个文盲或半文盲是不可能为计算机编程的，这是无可争议的。因此，同样明显的是，由他人编制的程序中的任何价值都不可能是从他那里偷来的。这就是为什么现在主要在看门人中听到工人『剥削』的呼声。</p>

            <!-- <p>Information technology is making it plain that the problem faced by persons of low skill is not that their productive capacities are being unfairly taken advantage of, but rather the fear that they may lack the ability to make a real economic contribution. As Kevin Kelly suggests in <em>Out of Control,</em>the “Upstart” car company of the Information Age may be the brainchild of “a dozen people,” who will outsource most of their parts, and still produce cars more carefully customized and tailored to their buyer’s wishes than anything yet seen from Detroit or Tokyo: “Cars, each one customer-tailored, are ordered by a network of customers and shipped the minute they are done.

            <!-- <p>The biggest changes in life occur to variables that no one watches. Or to put it another way, we take for granted variables that have fluctuated very little for centuries or even hundreds of generations. For most of history, if not for most of human existence, the balance between protection and extortion has fluctuated within a narrow margin, with extortion always holding the upper hand. Now that is about to change. Information technology is laying the groundwork for a fundamental shift in the factors that determine the costs and rewards of resorting to violence. The fact that intelligent agents will be available to investigate and perhaps retaliate in one fashion or another against those who initiate violence is merely a hint of this new vista in protection. Twenty-five years ago, the following statement would have been no more than the ranting of a crank: “If you kill me, I will sweep the money out of your bank accounts and give it to charities in Nepal.” After the turn of the millennium, it may not be. Whether it would prove to be a practical threat would be determined by factors of time and place. Yet even if the would-be miscreant’s accounts proved to be impermeable, there would surely be other costly mischief that an army of intelligent agents could impose in retaliation for a crime.

                在千年之交后，它可能不是。它是否会被证明是一种实际的威胁，将由时间和地点的因素决定。然而，即使潜在的不法分子的账户被证明是不可渗透的，也肯定会有其他代价高昂的恶作剧，而这些恶作剧是一支智能代理军队为报复犯罪而实施的。

Sometimes close relatives have answered the call. Sometimes tribal and clan-based groups have served as an unofficial police, responding to violence against any of their members with blood vendettas. Sometimes mercenaries or private guards have been employed to fend off attack, but not always as usefully as you might wish.

Under conditions that have heretofore existed, any group or agency that you could employ to successfully protect your life and wealth from attack would also necessarily have had the capacity to take either. That is a drawback for which there is no easy answer. Normally, you could look to competition to keep providers of an economic service from ignoring the wishes of their customers. But where violence is concerned, direct competition often has perverse results. In the past, it has usually led to increased violence. When two would-be protective agencies send their forces to arrest one another, the result is more akin to civil war than protection. When you are seeking protection from violence you normally do not wish to increase the output of violence but to suppress it. And to suppress it on terms that do not allow the plundering of the customers who pay for the protection service in the first place.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Local competition in the use of violence has usually meant paying higher costs for protection and enjoying less of it.

And they were isolated. They could draw on tight kinship relations to defend against most violent threats on a limited scale, which were the only sort they were likely to encounter. When they encountered larger threats, organized by states, they were overpowered and subjected to rule monopolized by outside groups. This happened over and over. Wherever societies have formed at a scale above bands and tribes, especially where trade routes brought different peoples into contact, specialists in violence have always emerged to plunder any surplus more peaceful people could produce. When technological conditions raised the returns to violence, they doomed societies that were not organized to channel large resources into making war.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>As we have said at several points, government’s principal economic function from the perspective of those who pay the taxes is to provide protection of life and property. Yet the government often operates like organized crime, extracting resources from people within its sphere of operations as tribute or plunder. Government is not only a protection service; it is also a protection racket. While government provides protection against violence originating with others, like the protection racket it also charges customers for protection against harm that it would otherwise impose itself. The first action is an economic service. The second is a racket. In practice, the distinction between the two forms of “protection” may be difficult to make. Governments, as Charles Tilly has pointed out, may perhaps be best understood as “our largest examples of organized crime.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en32" id="text00012.html#ch06en32">32</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如我们在一些地方所说，从纳税人的角度来看，政府的主要经济职能是为生命和财产提供保护。然而，政府的运作往往像有组织的犯罪团伙一样，从其运作范围内的人们那里提取资源作为贡品或掠夺。政府不仅是一种保护服务；它也是一种保护性的敲诈。虽然政府提供保护，防止源自他人的暴力，但就像保护费一样，它也向客户收取保护费，以避免自己受到伤害。第一个行为是一种经济服务。第二种则是敲诈。在实践中，这两种形式的『保护』可能很难区分。正如查尔斯·蒂利（<em>Charles Tilly</em>）所指出的那样，政府也许最好被理解为『我们最大的有组织犯罪的例子。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en32" id="text00012.html#ch06en32">32</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The activities of even the best government usually involved some mixture of the economic service of protection combined with extortion. Historically, both pursuits could be optimized if the government could impose a near-monopoly on coercion within the territories where it operates. In cases where a single armed group could establish predominance in the use of violence, the quality of the protection service it could provide was normally far superior to what could be had from one of several competing protection agencies thrown into battle over the same territory.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>即使是最好的政府的活动通常也涉及到保护经济服务与勒索的某种混合。从历史上看，如果政府能够在其运作的领土国家上对胁迫实行近乎垄断的统治，那么这两种追求都可以得到优化。在单一武装团体能够在使用暴力方面确立优势的情况下，它所提供的保护服务的质量通常远远优于在同一领土国家上被投入战斗的几个竞争性保护机构中的一个。</p>

            <!-- <h3>A Natural Monopoly on Land</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>对土地的自然垄断</h3>

            <!-- <p>Achievement of a local monopoly of coercion not only allowed a government to more effectively protect its potential customers from violence initiated by others; it also greatly reduced the government’s operating costs. As Lane put it, “The violence-using, violence-controlling industry was a natural monopoly, at least on land.

            <p>实现地方性的强制垄断，不仅使政府能够更有效地保护其潜在客户免受他人的暴力侵害，而且还能大大降低政府的运营成本。正如莱恩所说：『使用暴力、控制暴力的行业是一种自然垄断，至少在土地上是这样。在领土国家范围内，它所提供的服务可以通过垄断来更便宜地生产。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en33" id="text00012.html#ch06en33">33</a></sup>因此，『在一个毗连的领土国家内对使用武力的垄断使生产保护的企业能够改进其产品并降低其成本。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en34" id="text00012.html#ch06en34">34</a></sup>这样一个管理组织如果不用不断地进行军事行动来抵御竞争集团向其客户索取保护费，就可以用较少的费用提供更多的保护。</p>

            <!-- <p>The prospect that information technology will help “relax” the assumption that sovereignty must be based upon a territorial monopoly has already attracted the attention of political theorists. It is the theme of <em>Beyond Sovereignty: Territory and Political Economy in the Twenty-first Century,</em>by David J. Elkins. Elkins echoes our thesis that monopoly governments are destined to be disintermediated much as religious monopolies were in the years following 1500. He writes: “We used to assume that religions should have their own territory or ‘turf.’ As nations replaced universal religions as the sovereign arbiters of life and death, the ‘compactness’ and ‘boundedness’ of religion gave way to our now familiar intermingling of believers in the same area. Instead, we refuse to countenance the intermingling of nations, or provinces for that matter, although I believe this assumption is in the process of breaking down.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en35" id="text00012.html#ch06en35">35</a></sup>He goes on to argue, in keeping with our view, that territorial monopolies on sovereignty can be broken down without anarchy, as evidenced by the split in sovereignty between national and provincial governments in a federal system like Canada’s, and by the condominium government involving joint French and British sovereignty that characterized some Pacific Islands for much of this century. Thus, while territorial monopolies on sovereignty have rarely been unbundled by force, they can be unbundled by agreement. According to Elkins, and we agree, “The territorial nation has been a bundle or basket into which other facets of our lives are fit. It is similar to the economic concept of a ‘basket’ of goods—you cannot easily get items individually but must take them collectively. In a restaurant, one can order <em>‘a la carte’;</em>but as far as our identities are concerned, we must take what nations have bundled together, which amounts to <em>‘table d’hote.’</em>… Government <em>a la carte</em>will seem natural to citizens in the twenty-first century.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en36" id="text00012.html#ch06en36">36</a></sup>There is no development that will contribute more dramatically to the disaggregation of sovereignty and the rise of government a la carte than the emergence of a cybereconomy that altogether transcends physical borders.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>信息技术将有助于『放松』主权必须基于领土国家垄断的假设，这一前景已经引起了政治理论家的注意。这是《超越主权》（<em>Beyond Sovereignty</em>）的主题。大卫·J·埃尔金斯（David J. Elkins）的《超越主权：二十一世纪的领土国家与政治经济学》（Tritory and Political Economy in the Twenty-first Century）的主题。埃尔金斯回应了我们的论点，即垄断政府注定要被解除中介，就像宗教垄断在 1500
                年后的情况一样。他写道：『我们曾经认为，宗教应该有自己的领地或「地盘」。随着国家取代普遍的宗教成为生死的主权仲裁者，宗教的「紧凑性」和「边界性」让位于我们现在熟悉的同一地区的信徒的交融。相反，我们拒绝考虑国家或省份之间的交融，尽管我相信这种假设正在被打破。』
                <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en35" id="text00012.html#ch06en35">35</a></sup>他继续论证，与我们的观点一致，领土国家对主权的垄断可以在没有无政府状态的情况下被打破，像在加拿大这样的联邦制度中，国家和省级政府之间的主权分裂，以及本世纪大部分时间里一些太平洋岛屿的共管政府涉及法国和英国的联合主权就是证明。因此，虽然领土国家对主权的垄断很少通过武力来解除，但它们可以通过协议来解除。根据埃尔金斯的说法，我们同意，『领土国家一直是一个捆绑或篮子，我们生活的其他方面被装入其中。它类似于「一篮子商品」的经济概念
                —— 你不能轻易地单独获得物品，而必须全部采用。在餐馆里，人们可以点「点菜」，但就我们的身份而言，我们必须接受国家捆绑在一起的东西，这相当于「日式会席」…… 政府「点菜」对二十一世纪的公民来说却似乎很自然。『<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en36" id="text00012.html#ch06en36">36</a></sup>没有什么发展能比完全超越物理边界的网络经济的出现更显著地促进主权的分解和自选政府的崛起。</p>

If this comes to pass—as we believe it will, to judge by recent breakthroughs in integrated optics—the abundance of communications capability that would be created would result in a fantastic increase in cybercommerce.

Leased sovereignty is no more destabilizing than hosting a free-trade zone.

Where contending groups wrestle and maneuver in uneasy balance, the incentives to use predatory violence increase. Plunder becomes more attractive. Because power is less stable, and the local monopoly of coercion less secure, the time horizons of those with the capacity to employ violence shrinks. The “king of the mountain” may stand on such a slippery slope that he could not expect to survive long enough to realize a share of the substantial gains that ultimately result from containing violence.

He argued that the history of Western economies since the Dark Ages can be interpreted in terms of four stages of competition and monopoly in the organization of violence. While Lane is largely silent about the megapolitical factors that we identify as influencing the scale at which governments operate, his exploration of the economics of violence coincides closely with the argument we spelled out in <em>Blood in the Streets</em>and <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>and elsewhere in this volume.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>莱恩提出了一个论点，我们在想象信息时代如何发展的过程中误用了这个论点。他认为，自暗黑时代以来的西方经济史可以用暴力组织中的竞争和垄断的四个阶段来解释。虽然莱恩在很大程度上对我们认定的影响政府运作规模的跨政治因素保持沉默，但他对暴力经济学的探索与我们在《血流成河》和《大清算》以及本卷其他地方阐述的论点密切吻合。</p>

            <!-- <p>We have already analyzed some of the megapolitical factors that played a role in the evolution of Western society following the fall of Rome. Lane also examined this period, focusing on the economic consequences of that competition to monopolize violence. He discerned four important stages in the functioning of economies over the past thousand years, each involving a different phase in the organization of violence.<sup><a href="#text00012.html#ch06fn2" id="text00012.html#ch06-fn2">II</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <h3>走出暗黑时代</h3>

            <!-- <p>The first stage is one of “anarchy and plunder” that marked the feudal revolution of a thousand years ago. While Lane does not specify the dates for any of his summary periods, arithmetic sets the boundary of his first period quite clearly, and his description of the stage of “anarchy and plunder” seems to match conditions during the transition from the Dark Ages when the use of violence was “highly competitive, even on land.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en44" id="text00012.html#ch06en44">44</a></sup>He does not say why, but when violence is “highly competitive,” this usually means that there are significant obstacles to the projection of power at any distance. In military terms, defense is predominant over the offense.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>第一阶段是『无政府状态和掠夺』的阶段，标志着一千年前的封建革命。虽然莱恩没有具体说明他的任何一个总结时期的日期，但算术上很清楚地确定了他的第一个时期的边界，而且他对『无政府和掠夺』阶段的描述似乎与从暗黑时代过渡期间的条件相吻合，当时暴力的使用『高度竞争，甚至在陆地上。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en44" id="text00012.html#ch06en44">44</a></sup>他没有说原因，但当暴力『高度竞争』时，这通常意味着在任何距离上投射权力都有重大障碍。用军事术语来说，防御比进攻更重要。</p>

            <!-- <p>For reasons we explained in Chapter 3, this stage of “anarchy and plunder” coincided with falling productivity of agriculture due to adverse climatic changes. Since technology offered few effective economies of scale to help in securing a monopoly of violence at the time, competition between would-be rulers was widespread. Economic activity was smothered.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由于我们在第三章中解释的原因，这个『无政府状态和掠夺』的阶段正好与不利的气候变化导致的农业生产力下降相吻合。由于当时的技术几乎没有提供有效的规模经济来帮助确保对暴力的垄断，可能的统治者之间的竞争非常普遍。经济活动被扼杀了。</p>

            <!-- <p>The weakness of the economy made the problem of establishing a stable order worse. To create a local monopoly of violence involved too high a cost in military activity in proportion to the meager value of economic turnover. Without the capacity to enforce an effective monopoly over an economically viable territory, the armed knights on horseback terrorized and plundered while providing little in the way of “protection” for their customers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>经济的疲软使建立稳定秩序的问题更加严重。要建立一个地方性的暴力垄断，与经济营业额的微薄价值相比，军事活动的成本太高。由于没有能力对经济上可行的地区实行有效的垄断，马背上的武装骑士们在为他们的客户提供『保护』的同时，也进行了恐怖的『掠夺』。</p>

            <!-- <p>“The second stage begins when small regional or provincial monopolies are established.

Economic growth is held down by the absence of advantages of scale in the organization of violence, which keeps the military costs of enforcing local monopolies high. But while the costs remain high, the price that minisovereignties can charge for protection rises, since economic activity expands when anarchy is curtailed.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『第二阶段开始时，小型的地区或省级垄断企业建立起来。农业生产随之上升，大部分盈余由最近建立的暴力垄断者收集。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en45" id="text00012.html#ch06en45">45</a></sup>尽管如此，在这个第二阶段，盈余还是相对微薄，我们把它与中世纪早期联系起来。由于在组织暴力方面没有规模优势，经济增长受到抑制，这使得执行地方垄断的军事成本居高不下。但是，虽然成本居高不下，但由于无政府状态受到限制，经济活动扩大，因此，小国可以收取的保护费也随之上升。</p>

            <!-- <p>“During a late phase of the second stage many tribute takers attract customers by special offers to agricultural and commercial enterprise. They offer protection at low prices for those who will bring new lands into cultivation, and special policing services to encourage trade such as that organized by the Counts of Champagne for merchants coming to their fairs.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en46" id="text00012.html#ch06en46">46</a></sup>In other words, when they were able to establish a sufficient control over territory to negotiate credibly, local warlords did what local merchants do when they need to increase market share: they discounted their services to attract customers. The warlords later used the added resources from additional economic activity to consolidate their control over larger territories. Once that control was firmly established, they began to enjoy more of the advantages of monopoly. Their military costs for policing tended to fall, and they could also increase the price they charged without worrying that this made their service less attractive to customers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『在第二阶段的后期，许多进贡者通过向农业和商业企业提供特别优惠来吸引客户。他们为那些将新土地投入耕种的人提供低价保护，并提供特殊的治安服务以鼓励贸易，例如香槟伯爵为前来参加他们的集市的商人组织的服务。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en46" id="text00012.html#ch06en46">46</a></sup>换句话说，当他们能够建立起对领土国家的足够控制以进行可信的谈判时，当地军阀就像当地商人在需要增加市场份额时所做的那样：他们对自己的服务进行折扣以吸引客户。后来，军阀们利用额外经济活动带来的额外资源，巩固了他们对更大领土国家的控制。一旦这种控制牢固确立，他们开始享受更多的垄断优势。他们维持治安的军事成本趋于下降，而且他们还可以提高收费价格，而不必担心这使他们的服务对客户的吸引力下降。</p>

            <!-- <p>In this complicated stage in Western history, those who employ violence, the medieval lords and monarchs, take most of the surplus above subsistence. There are few merchants.

            <h3>工厂时代</h3>

            <!-- <p>Lane identifies the passage from the third to the fourth stage with the emergence of technological and industrial innovations as more important factors in earning profits than lowering the costs of protection. By this, Lane seems to refer to the period since 1750. From that time on, the character of technology began to play a clearly dominating role in the prosperity of regions. To take an extreme case, even areas where no government existed at all, as was the case in some parts of New Zealand, for example, prior to 1840, were not likely to become highly prosperous simply because they paid no taxes. At that point in history, innovations in industrial technology were more important to achieving profits than any savings that could be had by lowering the costs for protection, even to zero. As the scale of government rose, the credit and financing mechanisms originally pioneered by governments to raise resources for military operations became available to finance business enterprises of larger scale.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>莱恩认为，从第三阶段到第四阶段，技术和工业创新的出现是赚取利润的更重要因素，而不是降低保护的成本。通过这一点，莱恩似乎指的是 1750 年以来的时期。从那时起，技术的特征开始在地区的繁荣中发挥明显的主导作用。举个极端的例子，即使是完全没有政府存在的地区，例如 1840 年之前新西兰的一些地区，也不可能仅仅因为不交税而变得高度繁荣。在那个历史时期，工业技术的创新对于实现利润来说，比通过降低保护成本，甚至是降低到零来获得的任何节约都更加重要。随着政府规模的扩大，最初由政府开创的为军事行动筹集资源的信贷和融资机制也可用于资助规模更大的商业企业。</p>

            <!-- <p>Although Lane does not say so, the concentration of technological advantages in a given locale reduced the competition between jurisdictions and allowed “enterprises specializing in the use of violence,” or governments, to charge higher prices. When there are large technological gaps between the competitors in one jurisdiction and another, as there were during the Industrial Age, entrepreneurs in the jurisdictions with the best technology tend to make more money, even though they may have to pay higher taxes and other costs to their governments.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管莱恩没有这么说，但技术优势集中在某一地区，减少了各辖区之间的竞争，使『专门使用暴力的企业』，即政府，能够收取更高的价格。当一个辖区的竞争者与另一个辖区的竞争者之间存在巨大的技术差距时，就像工业时代那样，拥有最佳技术的辖区的企业家往往能赚到更多的钱，尽管他们可能要向政府支付更高的税收和其他费用。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Plunder with a Smile</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>微笑着掠夺</h3>

            <!-- <p>Governments in the Industrial Age enjoyed a delightful monopoly to exploit. Their actual costs for providing protection of life and limb were vanishingly small relative to the prices (taxes) they charged. Yet they really were in a realm where competition was so perverse that they could engage far more in the business of plunder than in that of protection and still have that fact go all but unnoticed. It was a rare moment in history.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>工业时代的政府享有一种令人愉快的垄断权，可以利用。相对于他们收取的价格（税收），他们提供生命和肢体保护的实际成本微乎其微。然而，他们确实处于一个竞争如此不正常的领域，以至于他们可以从事比保护工作更多的掠夺业务，而这一事实却几乎没有人注意到。这是历史上一个罕见的时刻。</p>

            <!-- <p>The drawbacks of anarchy under the megapolitical conditions of industrialism made competition in protection services within the same territory technologically infeasible. The only way to achieve effective protection under those conditions was to command a greater capability to employ violence. Therefore there was little to be gained by attempting to better distinguish that portion of one’s taxes that went, in Lane’s words, “as payment for the service rendered” from “another part that one is tempted to call plunder.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en48" id="text00012.html#ch06en48">48</a></sup>The distinction was surely real enough. But since one was stuck paying the taxes in any event, developing it fully had little to commend it other than satisfying morbid curiosity. As Lane said, no matter what portion of the taxes was plunder they were a price one had to pay “to avoid more severe losses.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en49" id="text00012.html#ch06en49">49</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在工业化的跨政治条件下，无政府状态的弊端使得在同一地区的保护服务竞争在技术上是不可行的。在这些条件下，实现有效保护的唯一途径是掌握更多的暴力能力。因此，用莱恩的话说，试图更好地区分一个人的税收中『作为对所提供的服务的付款』的部分和『另一部分，人们很想称之为掠夺』，是没有什么好处的。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en48" id="text00012.html#ch06en48">48</a></sup>这种区别肯定是足够真实。但是，由于人们在任何情况下都要支付税款，除了满足病态的好奇心之外，充分发展它没有什么值得称赞的地方。正如莱恩所说，『无论税收中的哪一部分是掠夺，它们都是人们必须付出的代价，以避免更严重的损失。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en49" id="text00012.html#ch06en49">49</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <h3>The Rise of Incomes Under Industrialism</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>工业主义下收入的增长</h3>

            <!-- <p>Part of the reason this dilemma was tolerable during the past two centuries of domination by the nation-state was the fact that incomes were rising dramatically, particularly in the jurisdictions where most industrial development was confined. Those running the OECD governments took a higher percentage of incomes almost every year. But the increase in plunder was nonetheless accompanied by far greater prosperity, and a greater inequality of wealth with the rest of the world. Under such conditions, objections to the surge of taxation were inevitably marginal and insufficient to deflect events from their logical progression. Indeed, for reasons spelled out in previous chapters, the military survival of an industrial nation-state largely depended upon the fact that no effective limits could be placed upon its claims on the resources of its citizens.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在过去两个世纪领土国家的统治下，这种两难局面可以被容忍的部分原因是，收入正在急剧上升，特别是在大多数工业发展所处的管辖区。那些管理 OECD 政府的人几乎每年都从收入中获取更高的比例。但是，在掠夺增加的同时，也出现了更大的繁荣，以及与世界其他地区财富的不平等。在这种情况下，对税收激增的反对意见不可避免地是边缘化的，不足以使事件偏离其逻辑发展。事实上，由于前几章所阐述的原因，工业化领土国家的军事生存在很大程度上取决于这样一个事实，即不能对其对公民资源的要求施加有效的限制。</p>

            <!-- <p>In every industrial state, policies meandered in more or less the same direction. At the high-water mark of industrialism after World War II, the rate of marginal income taxes reached 90 percent or higher. This was a far more aggressive assertion of the right of the state to extract resources than even the Oriental despots of the early hydraulic civilizations were prone to make. Yet the industrial version of plunder followed its own logic. Much of it was determined by the character of industrial technology in the first half of the twentieth century that we described earlier.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在每一个工业国家，政策都或多或少地朝着同一个方向徘徊。在二战后工业化的高潮时期，边际所得税率达到 90% 或更高。这是对国家开采资源的权利的更积极的主张，甚至比早期水力文明的东方专制者容易做出的主张还要积极。然而，工业版的掠夺遵循其自身的逻辑。其中大部分是由我们前面描述的二十世纪上半叶的工业技术的特点决定的。</p>

            <!-- <p>This technology made it all but inevitable that the state would seize and redistribute a large fraction of income, with much of the burden of the plunder falling upon a small segment of capitalists. Most industrial processes were heavily dependent on natural resources, and therefore tied to the sites where the resources were located. A steel mill, a mine, or a port could be moved only at staggering expense, or not at all. Such facilities were therefore stationary targets that could easily be taxed. Property, corporate, and severance taxes grew sharply over this century. So did income taxes, first on the capitalists, but eventually on the workers themselves. The advent of large-scale industrial employment made a broadly based income tax practical. Wages could be garnished at the source, with the tax authorities coordinating collections with the accounting departments of industrial firms. We take this for granted today, but collecting an income tax at the factory gate was a far simpler task than fanning out over the countryside to squeeze a portion of the profits from millions of independent craftsmen and farmers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种技术使得国家攫取和重新分配很大一部分收入几乎是不可避免的，而掠夺的大部分负担落在一小部分资本家身上。大多数工业流程都严重依赖自然资源，因此与资源所在的地点紧密相连。一个钢铁厂、一个矿场或一个港口只有在花费巨大的情况下才能移动，或者根本就不能移动。因此，这些设施是固定的目标，很容易被征税。本世纪以来，财产税、公司税和分割税急剧增长。所得税也是如此，首先是对资本家，但最终是对工人本身。大规模工业就业的出现使广泛的所得税成为现实。工资可以从源头上被扣押，税务机关与工业企业的会计部门协调征收。今天，我们认为这是理所当然的，但在工厂门口征收所得税，要比在乡下从数以百万计的独立工匠和农民身上榨取部分利润简单得多。</p>

            <!-- <p>In short, industrial technology tended to make taxation more routinized, more predictable, and less personally dangerous than taxation in many earlier periods. Nonetheless, it extracted a higher percentage of society’s resources than any form of sovereignty had done before.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>简而言之，与许多早期时期的税收相比，工业技术倾向于使税收更加常规化、更可预测、个人危险性更小。然而，与之前任何形式的主权相比，它提取的社会资源的比例更高。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Protecting What?</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>保护什么</h3>

            <!-- <p>The fact that societies could become richer while the total percentage of income absorbed in taxes rose significantly invites a question about the character of the protection that governments provided to industrial economies. What were they protecting? Our answer: primarily industrial installations with high capital costs and significant vulnerability to attack. The presence of large-scale industrial firms would not have been possible in a disordered environment with more competitive violence, even if the result of the competition had been to shrink the overall share of output taken by government.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>社会可以变得更加富有，而税收所吸收的总收入比例却大幅上升，这就引出了一个关于政府为工业经济提供保护的特点的问题。他们在保护什么？我们的答案是：主要是资本成本高、极易受到攻击的工业设施。在一个竞争更加激烈的无序环境中，大规模工业企业的存在是不可能的，即使竞争的结果是缩小了政府所占的总体产出份额。</p>

            <!-- <p>This is why capital-intensive operations are uneconomic in the American slums, as well as in Third World societies where ad hoc violence is endemic. Industrial society as a whole was able to proceed because a certain kind of order was established and maintained. Enterprises were subject to regular, predictable shakedowns, rather than erratic violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这就是为什么资本密集型业务在美国的贫民窟，以及在特设暴力流行的第三世界社会中是不经济的。工业社会作为一个整体能够继续发展，因为某种秩序已经建立并维持。企业受到定期的、可预测的洗劫，而不是无规律的暴力。</p>

            <!-- <p>Even during the height of industrialism, it was always an exaggeration to speak of a government employing a “monopoly of force.” All governments try to maintain such a monopoly, but as we have seen, employees of industrial corporations usually found that they were able to employ violence against their employers. As long as the general public has access to any arms at all, or a disorderly crowd retains the physical capacity to overturn a bus or throw rocks at police, those who control the government do not totally monopolize force. They merely control predominant force, dominant to a degree that it becomes uneconomic for most people to compete with them under existing conditions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>即使在工业主义的鼎盛时期，说政府采用『武力垄断』也总是夸大其词。所有政府都试图维持这种垄断，但正如我们所看到的，工业企业的雇员通常发现他们能够对其雇主使用暴力。只要普通民众能够获得任何武器，或者无序的人群还保留着掀翻公共汽车或向警察投掷石块的体能，那些控制政府的人就没有完全垄断武力。他们只是控制了占主导地位的武力，其主导程度使大多数人在现有条件下与他们竞争变得不经济。</p>

            <!-- <p>The Information Age is bringing into being a fifth stage in the evolution of competition in the use of violence in the West. This stage was not anticipated by Lane. This fifth phase involves competition in cyberspace, an arena not subject to monopolization by any “violence-using enterprise.” It is not subject to monopolization because it is not a territory.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>信息时代正在为西方使用暴力的竞争演变带来第五个阶段。这个阶段是莱恩没有预料到的。这第五个阶段涉及网络空间的竞争，这是一个不被任何『使用暴力的企业』所垄断的领域。它不受垄断的影响，因为它不是一个领土国家。</p>

            <!-- <p>Although Lane’s argument incorporates conventional postwar assumptions about the inevitability of the nation-state, he recognized a point that will be more crucial to understanding the future than it may have seemed forty or fifty years ago. That is the fact that governments have never established stable monopolies of coercion over the open sea. Think about it. No government’s laws have ever exclusively applied there. This is a matter of the utmost importance in understanding how the organization of violence and protection will evolve as the economy migrates into cyberspace, which has no physical existence at all. For the same reasons that Lane noted in observing that no government has ever been able to monopolize violence on the sea, it is even less likely that a government could successfully monopolize an infinite realm without physical boundaries.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管莱恩的论点包含了战后关于领土国家不可避免的传统假设，但他认识到，对于理解未来，有一点将比四、五十年前看起来更加关键。这就是政府从未在公海上建立稳定的强制力垄断的事实。想一想吧。没有一个政府的法律曾经专门适用于那里。这是一个极其重要的问题，可以理解当经济迁移到网络空间时，暴力和保护的组织将如何演变，因为网络空间根本就没有实体存在。正如莱恩在观察没有政府能够垄断海上暴力的原因一样，政府更不可能成功垄断一个没有物理边界的无限领域。</p>

            <!-- <h2>COMPETITION WITHOUT ANARCHY</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h2>没有无政府状态的妥协</h2>

            <!-- <p>In the past, when conditions made it difficult for any single violence-wielding entity to establish a monopoly, the results were anarchy and plunder. The Information Age, however, has changed the technological terms under which violence is organized and done so in a profound way. Unlike the past, when the inability to monopolize protection in a region meant higher military costs and lower economic returns, the fact that governments cannot monopolize cyberspace actually implies lower military costs and higher economic returns. This is because information technology creates a new dimension in protection. For the first time in history, information technology allows for the creation and protection of assets that lie entirely outside the realm of any individual government’s territorial monopoly on violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在过去，当条件使任何一个挥舞暴力的实体难以建立垄断时，结果就是无政府状态和掠夺。然而，信息时代已经改变了组织暴力的技术条件，并且以一种深刻的方式改变了这种条件。与过去不同的是，当时无法垄断一个地区的保护意味着更高的军事成本和更低的经济回报，而政府无法垄断网络空间的事实实际上意味着更低的军事成本和更高的经济回报。这是因为信息技术在保护方面创造了一个新的层面。历史上第一次，信息技术允许创造和保护完全在任何单个政府的领土国家垄断暴力领域之外的资产。</p>

In the past, when the reach of lords and kings was weak, and the claims of one or more overlapped at a frontier, something akin to competitive government existed. A look at how the march regions functioned could give insights into how laws of the march or something like them may migrate into cyberspace.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Andorra survives as a kind of fossilized march region between France and Spain, an artifact of megapolitical conditions that made it difficult for either kingdom to dominate the other in that cold and almost inaccessible area of 190 square miles in the Pyrenees. In 1278, an agreement was struck dividing suzerainty over Andorra between local French and Spanish feudal lords, the French count of Foix and the Spanish bishop of Urgel. Each appointed one of two “viquiers” who sparingly exercised the minimal authority of government in Andorra, mostly by commanding the tiny Andorran militia, now a police force. The count’s role was long ago superseded by history. The French government now stands in for him from Paris. Among its duties is to accept half of the annual tribute that Andorra pays, an amount less than a single month’s rent in a fleabag apartment. The bishop of Urgel continues to receive his share of the tribute, just as his predecessors did in the Middle Ages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>安道尔作为法国和西班牙之间的一种活化石一样的行军地区而存在，这是一种跨政治条件的产物，使任何一个王国都难以在比利牛斯山脉 190 平方英里的寒冷和几乎无法进入的地区支配对方。1278 年，达成了一项协议，将安道尔的宗主权划分给当地的法国和西班牙封建主，即法国的福瓦伯爵和西班牙的乌尔格尔主教。他们各自任命了两位『伯爵』中的一位，在安道尔很少行使政府的最低权力，主要是指挥小小的安道尔民兵，现在是一支警察部队。伯爵的作用早就被历史所取代了。现在，法国政府在巴黎为他代班。它的职责之一是接受安道尔每年缴纳的一半的贡品，这个数额还不到一个跳蚤公寓的一个月的租金。乌尔格尔的主教继续接受他的那份贡品，就像他的前辈在中世纪所做的那样。</p>

            <!-- <p>As the split tribute implies, there have been two sources of “supervisory jurisdiction and power” rather than one in Andorra. Appeals from Andorran civil suits were traditionally lodged either with the Episcopal College of Urgel or the Court of Cassation in Paris.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>A consequence of Andorra’s ambiguous position was that almost no laws were enacted. Andorra has enjoyed vanishingly small government and no taxes for more than seven hundred years. Today, that gives it a growing appeal as a tax haven. But until a generation ago, Andorra was famously poor. Once thickly wooded, it was deforested over the centuries by residents trying to stay warm in the bitter winters. The whole place is snowed shut from November through April each year. Even in summer, Andorra is so cold that crops grow only on the southern slopes. If our description makes it seem unappealing, you have just learned the secret of its success. Andorra survived as a feudal enclave in the age of the nation-state because it was remote and dirt-poor.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>安道尔立场模糊的一个后果是，几乎没有颁布任何法律。七百多年来，安道尔一直享有极小的政府，而且没有税收。今天，这使它作为一个避税天堂的吸引力越来越大。但在一代人之前，安道尔是著名的穷国。这里曾经树木茂盛，几个世纪以来，居民们为了在严冬中保持温暖而砍伐了森林。每年 11 月至次年 4 月，整个地方都被大雪封住。即使在夏天，安道尔也非常寒冷，农作物只能在南坡生长。如果我们的描述使它看起来不讨人喜欢，那么你刚刚知道了它成功的秘密。在领土国家时代，安道尔作为一块封建飞地得以生存，因为它地处偏远，土地贫瘠。</p>

            <!-- <p>At one time, there were numerous medieval frontier or “march” regions where sovereignties blended together. These violent frontiers persisted for decades or sometimes for centuries in the border areas of Europe. Most were poor. As we mentioned earlier, there were marches between areas of Celtic and English control in Ireland; between Wales and England, Scotland and England, Italy and France, France and Spain, Germany and the Slav frontiers of Central Europe, and between the Christian kingdoms of Spain and the Islamic kingdom of Granada. Like Andorra, these march regions developed distinct institutional and legal forms of a kind that we are likely to see again in the next millennium.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>曾几何时，有许多中世纪的边疆或『行军』地区，主权国家在那里混杂在一起。这些暴力的边境地区在欧洲的边境地区持续了几十年，有时甚至几个世纪。大多数都很贫穷。正如我们前面提到的，在爱尔兰的凯尔特人和英国人控制的地区之间，在威尔士和英格兰、苏格兰和英格兰、意大利和法国、法国和西班牙、德国和中欧的斯拉夫边疆之间，以及在西班牙的基督教王国和格拉纳达的伊斯兰王国之间，都存在着进军。像安道尔一样，这些行进中的地区形成了独特的制度和法律形式，我们有可能在下一个千年再次看到这种形式。</p>

            <!-- <p>Because of the competitive position of the two authorities, each of which was weak, rulers would sometimes even solicit volunteers among their subjects to settle in march regions in order to increase the reach of their authority. Almost as a matter of course, the subjects were lured into settling in the march by freedom from taxes. Given the delicate margins upon which they competed, if either authority in a march attempted to impose taxes, he would make it more difficult for his followers to make ends meet, as well as give everyone a reason to affiliate with his competitor. Therefore, residents of a march usually had a choice in deciding whose laws they were to obey. This choice was based upon the weakness of the competing authorities; it was not an ideological gesture.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由于两个当局的竞争地位，各自都很弱小，统治者有时甚至会在其臣民中征集志愿者到行军区定居，以扩大其权力的影响。几乎是理所当然的，臣民们被诱使在行军中定居，因为他们可以免于纳税。鉴于他们竞争的微妙利润，如果一个行军区的任何一个当局试图征税，他将使他的追随者更难维持生计，同时也给每个人提供了与他的竞争对手结盟的理由。因此，游行队伍中的居民通常有一个选择，即决定服从谁的法律。这种选择是基于相互竞争的当局的弱点；它不是一种意识形态的姿态。</p>

            <!-- <p>Nonetheless, practical difficulties arose that had to be resolved. Under feudalism, landlords who owned property on both sides of a nominal frontier faced a serious conflict of duties. For example, a lord on the frontier of Scotland and England who held properties in both kingdoms could theoretically owe military service to both in the event of war. To resolve this contradictory obligation, almost everyone up and down the feudal hierarchy could choose whose laws to obey through a legal process called avowal.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管如此，还是出现了必须解决的实际困难。在封建制度下，在名义上的边界两边拥有财产的地主面临着严重的责任冲突。例如，位于苏格兰和英格兰边境的领主，如果在两个王国都拥有财产，理论上在发生战争时，可能对两个王国都要服兵役。为了解决这种矛盾的义务，封建等级制度的上上下下几乎每个人都可以通过一种叫做 avowal 的法律程序来选择遵守谁的法律。</p>

            <!-- <p>Information technology will create equivalent opportunities for competitive choice in domiciling economic activities, but with important differences. One is that unlike the medieval frontier societies, cyberspace is likely to be in due course the richest of economic realms. It will therefore tend to be a growing rather than a receding frontier. Few persons at the core regions of medieval society would have wished to move to frontiers without strong inducements, often including religious imperatives, because these regions tended to be violent and poor. Therefore, they did not act as magnets drawing resources out of the control of the authorities. Cyberspace will.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>信息技术将创造出同等的机会，让人们在居住的经济活动中进行竞争性选择，但也有重要的区别。其中之一是，与中世纪的边疆社会不同，网络空间可能会在适当的时候成为最丰富的经济领域。因此，它将倾向于成为一个不断增长而不是不断消退的边疆。在中世纪社会的核心地区，如果没有强有力的诱因，通常包括宗教上的要求，很少有人愿意迁往边疆，因为这些地区往往是暴力和贫穷的。因此，它们并不像磁铁一样吸引当局控制之外的资源。网络空间会。</p>

            <!-- <p>Secondly, the new frontier will not be a duopoly, which invites collusion between the two authorities to compromise over their frontier claims. Such compromises tended not to be effective during the medieval period for two reasons: there were frequently sharp cultural gaps between the rival authorities; and more important, they lacked the physical capacity to impose a negotiated settlement, having insufficient military power on the ground. During the era of the nation-state, when national authorities did come to exercise sufficient military power to impose solutions, most march regions and vague frontiers disappeared. Border fixing became the norm. That is a stable solution if duopolists of violence face the prospect of dividing their authority over contiguous regions. But the competition in domiciling transactions in the cybereconomy will not be between two authorities, but between hundreds of authorities throughout the globe. For the territorial states to create an effective cartel to keep tax rates high will be all but impossible. This will be true for the same reason that collusion to enjoy monopoly prices in markets with hundreds of competitors does not work.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>其次，新的疆域不会是双头垄断，而双头垄断会招致两个当局之间的勾结，从而就其疆域主张做出妥协。在中世纪时期，这种妥协往往是无效的，原因有二：敌对当局之间经常存在尖锐的文化差距；更重要的是，他们缺乏实际能力，无法通过谈判解决问题，在当地没有足够的军事力量。在领土国家时代，当国家当局确实开始行使足够的军事力量来强行解决问题时，大多数游行地区和模糊的边界都消失了。边界的固定成为常态。如果暴力的双重垄断者面临着对毗连区域划分权力的前景，这就是一个稳定的解决方案。但是，网络经济中的住所交易的竞争将不是在两个当局之间，而是在全球数百个当局之间。对于领土国家所属国来说，建立一个有效的卡特尔来保持高税率是完全不可能的。这将是真实的，因为在有数百个竞争者的市场中，串通起来享受垄断价格是行不通的。</p>

            <!-- <p>For evidence, consider the move by the Seychelles, a tiny country in the Indian Ocean, to enact a new investment law that U.S. government officials describe as a “Welcome Criminals” act. Under the law, anyone who invests $10 million in the Seychelles will not only be guaranteed protection against extradition, but will be issued a diplomatic passport. Contrary to the assertions of the U.S. government, however, the intended beneficiaries are not drug dealers, who are generally under the protection of more important governments in any event, but independent entrepreneurs who have become politically incorrect. The first potential beneficiary of the Seychelles law is a white South African who became wealthy by circumventing the economic sanctions against the former apartheid regime. Now he faces the danger of economic retribution by the new South African government and is willing to pay the Seychelles for protection.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en52" id="text00012.html#ch06en52">52</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>作为证据，请考虑印度洋上的小国塞舌尔颁布新的投资法的举动，美国政府官员将其描述为『欢迎罪犯』法案。根据该法律，任何在塞舌尔投资 1000 万美元的人不仅将被保证不被引渡，而且还将获得一本外交护照。然而，与美国政府的断言相反，预期的受益者不是毒贩，他们在任何情况下通常都受到更重要的政府的保护，而是那些已经成为政治不正确的独立企业家。塞舌尔法律的第一个潜在受益者是一位南非白人，他通过规避对前种族隔离政权的经济制裁而变得富有。现在，他面临着被新的南非政府进行经济报复的危险，并愿意向塞舌尔支付保护费。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch06-en52" id="text00012.html#ch06en52">52</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Whatever the merits of any individual case, the example shows why attempts by governments to maintain a cartel for protection on the ground are doomed to failure.

            <!-- <p>In the age of the virtual corporation, individuals will choose to domicile their income-earning activities in a jurisdiction that provides the best service at the lowest cost. In other words, sovereignty will be commercialized. Unlike medieval frontier societies, which were in most cases impoverished and violent, cyberspace will be neither. The competition that information technology is driving governments to engage in is not competition of a military kind, but competition in quality and price of an economic service —genuine protection.

Rather, what we are saying is that violence is losing a good deal of its leverage. One possible reaction on the part of governments would be to intensify their use of violence in local settings in an attempt to compensate for its declining global significance. Whatever governments do, however, they will be unable to saturate cyberspace with violence in the way that they saturated the territories they monopolized with violence in the modern world. No matter how many governments try to enter cyberspace, they will be no more capable or powerful in that realm than anyone else.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Ironically, attempts by nation-states to wage “information wars” to dominate or thwart access to cyberspace would probably only accelerate their own demise. The tendency toward the devolution of large systems is already powerful because of the fallaway of scale economies and the rising costs of holding fragmenting social groups together.

A programmed virus could even close down conventional or nuclear generators, turning off segments of the electric grid. So-called logic bombs could scramble a great deal of information, the most sensitive of which is in central control systems operating vulnerable, large-scale systems inherited from the Industrial Age.

            <!-- <p>To a greater extent than is commonly realized, the immobility of people and their assets has informed the way we see the world. Even those who seem most ready to agree that the earth is a small place as the twentieth century ends continue to think in terms constrained by antiquated concepts of industrial politics. This is underscored by a slogan that became popular among environmentalists in the 1980s: “Think globally but act locally.” It is an injunction that mirrors the logic of politics, a logic that has always turned on local power advantages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在比人们普遍意识到的更大程度上，人们和他们的资产的不可移动性已经影响了我们看待世界的方式。即使是那些在二十世纪结束时似乎最愿意同意地球是一个小地方的人，也仍然在用过时的工业政治概念进行思考。二十世纪 80 年代在环保主义者中流行的一句口号就强调了这一点。『全球思考，本地行动。』这个口号反映了政治的逻辑，而政治的逻辑总是以地方权力优势为基础。</p>

            <!-- <p>The local habit of mind has been dictated by the megapolitics of all past societies. All topographical features that serve as barriers or facilitators to the exercise of power are local. Every river, every mountain, every island is local. Climate is local. Temperature, rainfall, and growing conditions vary as you climb up and over a mountain. Every microbe that circulates, circulates somewhere, and not in some other place.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当地人的思维习惯一直被过去所有社会的跨政治所支配着。所有作为行使权力的障碍或促进因素的地形特征都是本地的。每条河、每座山、每座岛都是本地的。气候是地方性的。温度、降雨量和生长条件随着你爬上或越过一座山而变化。每一种流通的微生物都在某个地方流通，而不是在另一个地方。</p>

            <!-- <p>Little wonder that the tyranny of place permeates our concepts of how society must organize and function. The power advantages that have given one group or another a local monopoly on violence have heretofore always originated someplace and faded along the megapolitical margins where borders are drawn. That is why there has never been a world government.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>难怪地方的暴政渗透到我们关于社会必须如何组织和运作的概念中。让一个群体或另一个群体在当地垄断暴力的权力优势，迄今总是起源于某个地方，并在划定边界的跨政治边缘消退。这就是为什么从来没有一个世界政府。</p>

            <!-- <p>While the importance of place to the exercise of power has rarely been made explicit, some advocates of compulsion to redistribute the rewards of human action began to sense the declining leverage of place as long ago as the 1930s. They saw in modern transportation a division of social space between the highly paid and the poor. This fear was captured by John Dos Passos in <em>The Big Money:</em>“The ‘vag’ sits on the edge of the highway, broken, hungry. Overhead, flies a transcontinental plane filled with highly paid executives. The upper class has taken to the air, the lower class to the road: there is no longer any bond between them, they are two nations.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en5" id="text00013.html#ch07en5">5</a></sup>This is another way of saying that improved transportation reduced the leverage of extortion simply by increasing the choice of places where successful persons might choose to be. Certainly, the vagabond on the road below was in no position to press for a handout from those flying overhead. The tendencies that Dos Passos observed sixty years ago have only become more pronounced.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>虽然地方对权力行使的重要性很少被明确指出，但一些主张强制重新分配人类行动回报的人早在 1930 年代就开始感觉到地方的影响力在下降。他们在现代交通中看到了社会空间在高收入者和贫困者之间的划分。约翰·多斯·帕索斯（<em>John Dos Passos</em>）在《大钱》（<em>The Big Money</em>）中捕捉到了这种恐惧：『「流浪汉」坐在高速公路的边缘，残破不堪，饥肠辘辘。头顶上，飞着一架横跨大陆的飞机，上面坐满了高薪的管理人员。上层阶级乘飞机，下层阶级走公路：他们之间不再有任何联系，他们是两个国家。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en5" id="text00013.html#ch07en5">5</a></sup>这是另一种说法，改善交通仅仅通过增加成功人士可能选择的地方来减少勒索的杠杆。当然，下面道路上的『流浪汉』没有资格要求那些从头顶飞过的人施舍。多斯·帕索斯在六十年前观察到的这种趋势只会变得更加明显。</p>

            <!-- <p>In 1995, a million persons crossed borders somewhere in the world each day. This represents a startling change from the past. Before the twentieth century, travel was so infrequent that most borders were simply frontiers, not barriers to transit. Passports were unknown. The development of ocean liners, trains, and other improved forms of transportation dramatically increased movement. But this movement became more heavily regulated by states whose powers were increased by the same improvements in transportation and communications that made civilian travel cheaper and easier. The advent of movies and, especially, television also did a great deal to open horizons and stimulate travel and immigration. Yet until now, the bedrock assumptions of social and economic organization have remained anchored in locality.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

The many doubters of the economic importance of cyberspace are the Colonel Blimps of the Information Age. Their complacency rivals that of the British establishment facing the decline of the empire in the 1930s. Whenever elites find themselves threatened, their first reaction is denial. This is evidenced by the fond hope that the Internet will never amount to much, sometimes endorsed by authorities who should know better. We referred earlier to David Kline and Daniel Burstein’s work, <em>Road Warriors: Dreams and Nightmares Along the Information Highway.</em>Their dismissal of the economic potential of the Net is another proof that being technically well-informed is not synonymous with understanding the consequences of technology,<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en7" id="text00013.html#ch07en7">7</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Even the most technically expert observers in the past have frequently failed to grasp the implications of new technologies. A British parliamentary committee, convened in 1878 to consider the prospects for Thomas Edison’s incandescent lamp, reported Edison’s ideas to be “good enough for our transatlantic friends,… but unworthy of the attention of practical or scientific men.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en8" id="text00013.html#ch07en8">8</a></sup>Thomas Edison himself was a man of great vision, but he thought that the phonograph he invented would be employed mainly by businessmen for dictation. Only a short time before the Wright brothers proved that airplanes would fly, the distinguished American astronomer Simon Newcomb authoritatively demonstrated why heavier-than-air flight was impossible. He concluded: “The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of force, can be united in a practical machine by which men shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en9" id="text00013.html#ch07en9">9</a></sup>Soon after airplanes began to fly, another renowned astronomer, William H. Pickering, explained to the public why commercial travel would never get off the ground: “The popular mind often pictures gigantic flying machines speeding across the Atlantic and carrying innumerable passengers in a way analogous to our modern steamships.…It is clear that with our present devices there is no hope of competing for racing speed with either our locomotives or our automobiles.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en10" id="text00013.html#ch07en10">10</a></sup>We have previously recalled another wildly inaccurate prophecy about the potential of a new technology—the forecast from the beginning of the twentieth century by the makers of Mercedes that there would never be more than a million automobiles worldwide. Again, they knew more about automobiles than almost anyone but they could not have been more wrong in estimating the impact of autos on society.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>即使是过去最专业的技术观察员也经常无法把握新技术的影响。一个英国议会委员会于 1878 年召开会议，审议托马斯·爱迪生的白炽灯的前景，报告说爱迪生的想法『对我们的跨大西洋朋友来说足够好…… 但不值得实用或科学人士关注。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en8" id="text00013.html#ch07en8">8</a></sup>托马斯·爱迪生本人是一个有远见的人，但他认为他发明的留声机将主要被商人用于口述。就在莱特兄弟证明飞机会飞之前不久，杰出的美国天文学家西蒙·纽科姆权威性地证明了为什么比空气重的飞行是不可能的。他总结道。『在作者看来，已知的物质、已知的机械形式和已知的力的形式，没有任何可能的组合可以结合在一个实用的机器中，使人可以在空中飞行很远的距离，这在符合对任何物理事实的证明。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en9" id="text00013.html#ch07en9">9</a></sup>在飞机开始飞行后不久，另一位著名的天文学家威廉·H·皮克林向公众解释了为什么商业旅行将永远无法起步。『在大众的心目中，巨大的飞行器经常在大西洋上飞驰，载着无数的乘客，其方式类似于我们的现代蒸汽船……
                显然，以我们目前的设备，没有希望与我们的火车头或汽车竞争速度。』

Information technology divorces income-earning potential from residence in any specific geographic location. Since a greater and greater portion of the value of products and services will be created by adding ideas and knowledge to the product, an ever-smaller component of value-added will be subject to capture within local jurisdictions.

Such transactions are not yet directly subversive of the old institutions. They employ industrial currency, and take place within identifiable jurisdictions. These uses of the Internet have little such megapolitical impact.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

More examples of these new applications of advanced computational power are spelled out below. The second stage of Net commerce will still function within the old institutional framework, employing national currencies and submitting to the jurisdiction of nation-states. The merchants who employ the Net for sales will not yet employ it to bank their profits, only to earn revenues. These profits made on Internet transactions will still be subject to taxation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>3. A more advanced stage will mark the transition to true cybercommerce. Not only will transactions occur over the Net, but they will migrate outside the jurisdiction of nation-states. Payment will be rendered in cybercurrency. Profits will be booked in cyberbanks. Investments will be made in cyberbrokerages. Many transactions will not be subject to taxation. At this stage, cybercommerce will begin to have significant megapolitical consequences of the kind we have already outlined. The powers of governments over traditional areas of the economy will be transformed by the new logic of the Net. Extraterritorial regulatory power will collapse. Jurisdictions will devolve. The structure of firms will change, and so will the nature of work and employment.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>3. 一个更高级的阶段将标志着向真正的网络商务的过渡。不仅交易将在网络上发生，而且它们将迁移到领土国家的管辖范围之外。付款将以网络货币进行。利润将被记入网络银行。投资将在网络经纪公司进行。许多交易将不会被征税。在这个阶段，网络商务将开始产生我们已经概述过的那种重大的跨政治后果。政府对传统经济领域的权力将被网络的新逻辑所改变。域外的监管权力将崩溃。管辖权将被移交。公司的结构将发生变化，工作和就业的性质也将改变。</p>

Instead of having to make large incisions with scalpels, the surgeon will make micro incisions with probes, and will be able to see what the probes reveal as he operates. He will perform the surgery from the image rather than by looking directly into the body. In principle, the probes will be operable from a distance. They will be able to destroy tumors with laser or cryogenic—heating or freezing—devices of great precision.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

From this perspective, the additional $80,000 a year of income tax paid above that generous level might well be classified as tribute or plunder. Forty-five thousand dollars is certainly a substantial payment toward the maintenance of law and order, considering that police protection is meant to be a public good. In theory, public goods can be extended to additional users at a marginal cost of zero.

            <p>你可能会反对，20% 的年回报率是一个高回报率。毫无疑问，你是对的。但是，鉴于亚洲近几十年来惊人的增长，世界上许多投资者已经取得了这个成绩，甚至更好。自 1950 年以来，香港房地产的复合回报率每年都超过 20%。即使是一些不那么广为人知的经济增长，也提供了容易获得高额利润的机会。在过去的三十年里，你可以在巴拉圭银行的美元存款中获得平均每年超过 30% 的实际回报。高投资回报在一些地方比其他地方更容易实现，但熟练的投资者在好的年份肯定可以实现 20% 或更多的利润，即使他们不能持续地与乔治·索罗斯或沃伦·巴菲特的表现相媲美。

            <!-- <p>Obviously, the higher the rate of return that you could earn on your capital, the greater the opportunity costs that predatory income and capital gains taxes impose. But the conclusion that the loss is huge, indeed greater than the total amount of wealth that you may ever accumulate, does not depend upon your being able to achieve outlandish rates of return. Some mutual funds operating in the United States have averaged annual gains of more than 10 percent for more than half a century. If you could do no better than that and you are among the top 1 percent of American earners, then your net worth is reduced by more than $33 million just by the income tax you pay in excess of $45,000 annually. Compared to a jurisdiction without income tax, the loss is $55 million.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>显然，你的资本可以获得的回报率越高，掠夺性收入和资本利得税所带来的机会成本就越大。但是，损失巨大，确实大于你可能积累的财富总额的结论，并不取决于你能取得离奇的回报率。在美国经营的一些共同基金在半个多世纪以来，平均年收益超过 10%。如果你不能做得更好，而且你是美国收入最高的 1%，那么你的净资产仅因你每年支付的超过 45,000 美元的所得税就减少了 3300 多万美元。与没有所得税的司法管辖区相比，其损失为 5500 万美元。</p>

            <h3>55 美元，而不是 5500 万美元</h3>

            <!-- <p>If the profit-maximizing assumptions of economists are correct, as we believe they generally are, one of the more certain predictions you could make is that most people would act to salvage $55 million if they could. That is our prediction. When the black magic of compound interest becomes more clear in the minds of successful people in high-tax countries, they will begin to shop in earnest among jurisdictions, just as they now shop for automobiles or compare rates on insurance policies. If you doubt it, merely stop people at random on the streets of New York or Toronto and ask whether they would move to Bermuda for $55 million. The question answers itself. The quandary it poses is reminiscent of that Mark Twain imagined in deciding whether he would prefer to spend the night with Lillian Russell stark naked or General Grant in full dress uniform. He did not deliberate long. Residents of mature welfare states, particularly the United States, may be slower on the uptake, but only because they are not yet aware of the choice they face. In the fullness of time, they will be. You or anyone motivated by the desire to live a better life will see the attraction of reducing the losses you suffer from predatory taxation. You need merely lodge your transactions in cyberspace. This will, of course, be illegal in many jurisdictions. But old laws seldom can resist new technology. In the 1980s, it was illegal in the United States to send a fax message. The U.S. Post Office considered faxes to be first-class mail, over which the U.S. Post Office claimed an ancient monopoly. An edict to that effect was issued reiterating the requirement that all fax transmissions be routed to the nearest post office for delivery with regular mail. Billions of fax messages later, it is unclear whether anyone ever complied with that law. If so, compliance was fleeting. The advantages of operating in the emerging cybereconomy are even more compelling than sidestepping the post office in sending a fax.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>如果经济学家的利润最大化假设是正确的，正如我们认为他们通常是正确的，你可以做出的一个更确定的预测是，如果可以的话，大多数人会采取行动挽回 5500 万美元。这就是我们的预测。当复利的黑魔法在高税率国家的成功人士的头脑中变得更加清晰时，他们将开始认真地在不同的司法管辖区之间购物，就像他们现在购买汽车或比较保险单的费率一样。如果你怀疑这一点，只需在纽约或多伦多的街道上随机拦住人们，问他们是否愿意为 5500 万美元搬到百慕大。这个问题本身就是答案。它所提出的难题让人想起马克·吐温在决定他是愿意与赤身裸体的莉莲·拉塞尔过夜还是愿意与穿着全套制服的格兰特将军过夜时所想象的情况。他并没有考虑很久。成熟的福利国家的居民，特别是美国的居民，可能在接受方面比较慢，但只是因为他们还没有意识到他们所面临的选择。随着时间的推移，他们会意识到。你或任何被改善生活的愿望所驱使的人都会看到减少你因掠夺性征税而遭受的损失的吸引力。你只需要把你的交易放在网络空间里。当然，这在许多地区是非法的。但旧的法律很少能抵制新的技术。在二十世纪
                80 年代，在美国发送传真信息是非法的。美国邮局认为传真是头等邮件，美国邮局声称对其有古老的垄断权。为此颁布了一项法令，重申要求所有的传真传输都要转到最近的邮局，与普通邮件一起投递。数以亿计的传真信息之后，目前还不清楚是否有人遵守过这一法律。如果有，遵守也是转瞬即逝。在新兴的网络经济中运营的优势甚至比在发送传真时避开邮局更有说服力。</p>

Lane’s words, “of poor quality and outrageously overpriced.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en13" id="text00013.html#ch07en13">13</a></sup>This habit of charging far more than government’s services are actually worth developed through centuries of monopoly. Taxes were ruthlessly raised on anyone who seemed capable of paying—precisely because governments had a monopoly or near-monopoly on coercion. This tradition of monopoly will clash in a profound way with the new megapolitical possibilities of cybercommerce.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>政府已经习惯于强加『保护服务』，用 Frederic C. 莱恩的话说，就是』质量差，价格高得离谱。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en13" id="text00013.html#ch07en13">13</a></sup>这种收费远远超过政府服务实际价值的习惯是通过几个世纪的垄断形成的。税收被无情地提高到任何似乎有能力支付的人身上 —— 正是因为政府垄断了或几乎垄断了强制力。这种垄断的传统将与电子商务的新的跨政治可能性发生深刻的冲突。</p>

            <!-- <p>Encryption will make it easy to protect transactions in cyberspace. The cost of an effective encryption software program, like PGP, is less than the commission charged by a full-service broker on a trade of one hundred shares. Yet it will render almost any transaction invisible and impervious to governments and thieves for many years to come. The new technology of the Information Age will effectively protect cyberassets at a vanishingly small cost. For $55 rather than $55 million, participants in the cybereconomy will enjoy better actual protection of their assets than they enjoyed during the industrial era or at any previous time in history. Easily used encryption algorithms and the capacity to shop between terrestrial domiciles for transactions will provide effective protection against the largest source of predation, nation-states themselves.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>加密将使保护网络空间的交易变得容易。一个有效的加密软件程序，如 PGP，其成本低于一个提供全面服务的经纪人对 100 股交易收取的佣金。然而，它将使几乎所有的交易都不可见，并且在未来的许多年里不被政府和盗贼发现。信息时代的新技术将以极小的成本有效地保护网络资产。只要花 55 美元而不是 5500 万美元，网络经济的参与者将享受到比工业时代或历史上任何时候都要好的实际资产保护。易于使用的加密算法和在地面住所之间进行交易的能力将提供有效的保护，以防止最大的掠夺来源，即领土国家本身。</p>

            <!-- <p>That is not to say that territorial governments will be entirely outmaneuvered. They will still be able to exploit vulnerabilities to personal harm in order to extract head taxes, or perhaps even hold wealthy individuals to outright ransom. They will also be able to enforce collection of consumption taxes. Yet protection, the most important service governments provide, will be put on a more nearly competitive basis. Less of the cost that productive people pay for protection will be available to be seized and reallocated by political authorities. Technological innovations will place a large and growing portion of the world’s wealth outside the reach of governments. This will reduce the risks of trade, sharply lowering, in historian Janet Abu-Lughod’s words, “the proportion of all costs” that otherwise would have had to be “allocated to transit duties, tribute, or simple extortion.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en14" id="text00013.html#ch07en14">14</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这并不是说，领土国家政府将被完全击败。他们仍然能够利用对个人伤害的弱点，以提取人头税，甚至可能将富有的个人直接勒索。他们也将能够强制征收消费税。然而，作为政府提供的最重要的服务，保护将被放在一个更接近竞争的基础上。生产者为保护而支付的费用将被政治当局攫取和重新分配。技术创新将把世界财富的很大一部分和越来越大的一部分置于政府的范围之外。这将降低贸易的风险，用历史学家珍妮特·阿布·卢霍德的话说，『所有成本的比例将大幅降低，否则就不得不分配给过境税、贡品或简单的勒索』。

            <!-- <p>It has been rare in history to find governments truly constrained by competition. In the few times when something remotely like this has happened, governments were weak and technologies were similar between jurisdictions. As Lane suggested, the principal factor affecting profitability under such conditions tends to be the difference in protection costs paid by different entrepreneurs. The medieval merchant who had to pay twenty tolls to bring his goods to market could not compete with a merchant who had to pay only four tolls to deliver the same goods to the customer. Similar conditions are destined to return with the Information Age. Profitability will once again be determined not so much by technological advantage as by your success in minimizing the costs you are forced to pay for protection.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在历史上，真正受制于竞争的政府并不多见。在少数几次发生类似的情况时，政府是软弱的，而且各管辖区的技术是相似的。正如莱恩所言，在这种情况下，影响利润率的主要因素往往是不同企业家所支付的保护成本的差异。中世纪的商人必须支付 20 个过路费才能把货物运到市场，他无法与只需支付 4 个过路费就能把同样的货物送到客户手中的商人竞争。类似的情况注定会随着信息时代的到来而重新出现。盈利能力将再次由技术优势决定，而不是由你成功地将你被迫支付的保护费用降到最低。</p>

            <!-- <p>This new economic dynamic directly contradicts the desire of government left over from the industrial era to impose monopoly pricing for its protection services. But, like it or not, the old system will be nonviable in the new competitive environment of the Information Age. Any government that insists upon lumbering its citizens with heavy taxes that competitors do not pay will merely assure that profits and wealth gravitate someplace else. Therefore, the failure of the mature welfare states to curtail taxes over the long term will be self-correcting. Governments that tax too much will simply make residence anywhere within their power a bankrupting liability.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种新的经济动态与工业时代遗留下来的政府对其保护服务实行垄断定价的愿望直接相抵触。但是，不管你愿不愿意，在信息时代新的竞争环境中，旧的系统将是不可行的。任何政府如果坚持向其公民征收竞争者不支付的重税，就只能保证利润和财富转移到其他地方。因此，成熟的福利国家在长期削减税收方面的失败将是自我纠正的。税收过高的政府只会使其权力范围内的任何地方的住宅成为破产的责任。</p>

Hayek argued, there is “no clear distinction between money and non-money.” He wrote, “although we usually assume there is a sharp line of distinction between what is money and what is not—and the law generally tries to make such a distinction—so far as the causal effects of monetary events are concerned, there is no such clear difference. What we find is rather a continuum in which objects of various degrees of liquidity, or with values which can fluctuate independently of each other, shade into each other in the degree to which they function as money.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en17" id="text00013.html#ch07en17">17</a></sup>Digital money on global computer networks will make every object on Hayek’s continuum of liquidity more liquid—except government paper. One consequence will be that barter will become far more practical. Increasing numbers of objects and services will be offered in specific bids for other objects and services. These potential transactions will be widely advertised throughout the world on the Net, which will increase their liquidity by magnitudes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在电子经济中，你将能够以你希望的任何媒介进行交易。正如已故诺贝尔奖得主哈耶克（F. A.

            <!-- <p>One of the principal drawbacks of barter has always been the difficulty of matching a person with one specific demand with another who had exactly that on offer and was seeking to acquire for himself exactly what the first proposed to trade. Primitive barter stumbled over the daunting improbability of exactly matching two parties wishing to exchange in a local market. Cash transcended the limitations of barter, and its advantages will continue to be compelling in most transactions. But vast increases in computational power and the globalization of commerce in cyberspace also reduce the drawbacks of barter. The odds of finding someone with exactly reciprocal desires to yours increase dramatically when you can sort instantly across the entire world rather than drawing on only those whom you might meet locally.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Governments issuing these receipts soon found that they could print far more of them than they could actually redeem from their supply of bullion. This was easy. No individual holding a gold or silver certificate could distinguish any information about the actual supply of precious metals from his receipt. Other than the serial numbers, all the receipts looked alike, a fact that appealed to counterfeiters as well as politicians and bankers seeking to profit from inflating the supply of money.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Private competing currencies circulated in Scotland from early in the eighteenth century until 1844. During that period, Scotland had no central bank. There were few regulations or restrictions on entry into the banking business. Private banks took deposits and issued their own private currencies backed by gold bullion. As Professor Lawrence White has documented, this system worked well. It was more stable, with less inflation than the more heavily regulated and politicized system of banking and money employed in England during the same period.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en21" id="text00013.html#ch07en21">21</a></sup>Michael Prowse of the <em>Financial Times</em>summarized Scotland’s free-banking experience: “There was little fraud.

            <!-- <h2>ERADICATING INFLATION</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h2>消除通货膨胀</h2>

            <!-- <p>Such possibilities notwithstanding, surely the most momentous consequence of the new digital money will be the end of inflation and the deleverage of the financial system. The economic implications are profound. The rise of inflation in the twentieth century, as we argued in <em>Blood in the Streets</em>and <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>was intimately connected with the balance of power in the world. Increasing returns to violence dictated sharply higher military expenditures, which in turn required ever more aggressive efforts to expropriate wealth. Governments found that they could effectively impose an annual wealth tax on all who held balances in their national currencies. This annual wealth tax on currency holders could also be seen as a transaction fee for allowing the users of currency to maintain their wealth in a convenient form provided by the issuers.<sup><a href="#text00013.html#ch07fn1" id="text00013.html#ch07-fn1">I</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管有这些可能性，新的数字货币最重要的后果肯定是通货膨胀的结束和金融系统的去杠杆化。其经济影响是深远的。正如我们在《喋血街头》和《大清算》中所论述的那样，二十世纪通货膨胀的兴起与世界权力的平衡密切相关。越来越多的暴力回报决定了军事开支的急剧增加，而这又需要更加积极地征用财富。各国政府发现，他们可以有效地对所有持有本国货币余额的人征收年度财富税。这种对货币持有者征收的年度财富税也可以被看作是一种交易费用，因为它允许货币使用者以发行者提供的便利形式维持他们的财富。<sup><a href="#text00013.html#ch07fn1" id="text00013.html#ch07-fn1">I</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Thinking of inflation as a transaction fee for the convenience of holding currency may be unusual, but consider it closely. During the Industrial Age we became so accustomed to thinking of the provision of currency as a service for which one does not pay directly, that it was easy to forget that the issuers of the dollars, pesos, pounds, and francs, namely governments, did require that we pay, and pay dearly—through inflation. The rate of this inflationary transaction fee on currency varied during the last half century from a low of 2.7 percent annually for the German mark, to rates perilously close to 100 percent. For example, between 1960 and 1991, when President Menem launched Argentina’s currency-board reform, inflation struck seventeen zeros off successive versions of Argentine currency. If all the wealth of the world had been converted into Argentine pesos in 1960 and buried, it would not have been worth the effort to spade it up by 1991.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>将通货膨胀视为持有货币的便利性的交易费用可能是不寻常的，但仔细想想。在工业时代，我们已经习惯于将货币的提供视为一种不需要直接付费的服务，以至于很容易忘记美元、比索、英镑和法郎的发行者，即政府，确实要求我们付费，而且是通过通货膨胀付费。在过去的半个世纪里，货币的这种通货膨胀交易费率从德国马克每年 2.7% 的低点到接近 100% 的危险比率不等。例如，在 1960 年至 1991 年期间，当梅内姆总统启动阿根廷的货币委员会改革时，通货膨胀将阿根廷货币的连续版本打掉了 17 个零。如果世界上所有的财富都在
                1960 年被兑换成阿根廷比索并被埋葬，那么到 1991 年就不值得再去铲除它了。</p>

            <!-- <p>Argentina’s example is a leading indicator for the next millennium. Currency will not be inflated because other nation-states will no longer be able to get away with it just as Argentina no longer can. The difference will be that private money dispersed over the Net will be even less susceptible to a reversal in policy than Argentina’s automatic currency-board system, which could be damaged by a credit contraction imported from other countries. Private money will not be inflatable because of competitive market pressures.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>阿根廷的例子是下一个千年的一个领先指标。货币不会被膨胀，因为其他领土国家将不再能够像阿根廷一样逃脱，也不再能够逃脱。不同的是，分散在网络上的私人货币将比阿根廷的自动货币板系统更不容易受到政策逆转的影响，后者可能被从其他国家输入的信贷收缩所破坏。由于市场竞争的压力，私人货币将不会出现通货膨胀。</p>

            <!-- <p>The death of inflation will take away the disguised profits that inflation previously conveyed to those who were the monopolistic issuers of currency. If all the disguised profits of issuing money were extinguished, a new method of payment would be needed to compensate the issuers of currency directly. Use of the new monetary system will therefore probably involve a more explicit transaction cost, perhaps a fee on the order of 1 percent per annum. This will be a small price to pay compared to the annual inflationary penalty of from 2.7 percent to 99 percent imposed by nation-states. All the more so, because there is a likelihood that overall prices will decline in the future as monopolies are eroded and competition intensifies worldwide.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>通货膨胀的死亡将带走通货膨胀以前传达给那些垄断性货币发行者的变相利润。如果发行货币的所有变相利润都被消灭了，那么就需要一种新的支付方式来直接补偿货币发行者。因此，使用新的货币体系将可能涉及更明确的交易成本，也许是每年 1% 左右的费用。与领土国家施加的每年 2.7% 到 99% 的通货膨胀惩罚相比，这将是一个很小的代价。更重要的是，随着垄断的削弱和世界范围内竞争的加剧，未来总体价格有可能下降。</p>

            <!-- <p>The emergence of digital money will not only defeat inflation once and for all; it will also contract leverage in the banking systems of the world. The ability of people everywhere to bypass regulatory authorities and shift their funds directly through the Internet is an entirely unprecedented consequence of the globalization of markets. It will be beyond the power of any government to regulate. When governments can no longer depreciate currency by printing money or defraud savers by expanding credit at will through captive banking systems, they will lose a major part of their indirect capacity to commandeer resources.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

At the same time, they will retain the unfunded liabilities and inflated expectations for social spending inherited from the industrial era. The result to be expected is an intense fiscal crisis with many unpleasant social side effects that we will consider in later chapters.

Some governments may even seek to remonetize gold as another expedient to meet competition from private currencies. They may well reason that they could gain higher seigniorage profits from a loosely controlled nineteenth-century gold standard than would be the case if they allowed their national currency to be displaced entirely by commercial cybermoney. But not all governments will respond in the same way. Those in regions where computer usage and Net participation are low may opt for old-fashioned hyperinflation in the early stages of the cybereconomy.

These new stewards of the world’s wealth are likely to prove far abler than politicians in utilizing resources and deploying investment. For the first time in history, megapolitical conditions will allow the ablest investors and entrepreneurs rather than specialists in violence ultimate control over capital. It is not unreasonable to expect that the rates of return on this dispersed, market-driven investment could be double or triple the meager returns from the politically driven budget allocations of the nation-state era. It was not uncommon in the final decades of the twentieth century to find examples in any country of government investment that were substantially negative. We cited official Russian statistics in the revised version of <em>The Great Reckoning</em>from November 1992, suggesting that the whole of Russia’s economy was “worth just $30 billion, less than a third of the value of its raw-material inputs. By implication, the output of Russia’s economy would more than triple in value if the domestic manufacturing and service economy were shut down completely.

                300 亿美元，还不到其原材料投入价值的三分之一。言下之意，如果国内的制造业和服务业完全关闭，俄罗斯的经济产出将增加三倍以上的价值。他们不是在贡献价值，而是在减少价值。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch07-en23" id="text00013.html#ch07en23">23</a></sup></p>

The cybereconomy of the Information Age will be more free than any other commercial realm in history. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the cybereconomy will rapidly become the most important new economy of the new millennium. Its success will attract new participants from everywhere on the globe, in the same way that the wide use of fax machines made telecopying increasingly attractive for nonusers.

            <h2>超越帕雷托法则的巨大力量</h2>

            <!-- <p>Pareto’s law says that 80 percent of the benefit will depend on or go to 20 percent of those engaged. This may be approximately true, though, more strikingly, 1 percent of the population of the United States pays 28.7 percent of the income tax, suggesting that as societies advance into the Information Age they will experience an even more skewed distribution of incomes and abilities than Vilfredo Pareto observed at the end of the last century. People are quite accustomed to substantial inequalities of wealth. In 1828, 4 percent of New Yorkers were thought to have owned 62 percent of all the city’s wealth. By 1845, the top 4 percent owned about 81 percent of all corporate and noncorporate wealth in New York City. More broadly, the top 10 percent of the population owned about 40 percent of the wealth across the whole United States in 1860. By 1890, records suggest that the richest 12 percent then owned about 86 percent of America’s wealth.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en1" id="text00014.html#ch08en1">1</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>帕雷托法则说，80% 的利益将取决于或归于 20% 的参与人。这可能是近乎真实的，但更引人注目的是，美国 1% 的人口支付了 28.7% 的所得税，这表明随着社会进入信息时代，他们将经历比维尔弗雷多·帕累托在上世纪末观察到的更加倾斜的收入和能力分配。人们已经相当习惯于财富的巨大不平等。在 1828 年，4% 的纽约人被认为拥有该市所有财富的 62%。到 1845 年，前 4% 的人拥有纽约市所有公司和非公司财富的 81%。更广泛地说，1860 年，前 10% 的人口拥有整个美国约
                40% 的财富。1890 年，最富有的 12% 的人拥有美国约 86% 的财富。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en1" id="text00014.html#ch08en1">1</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The 1890 numbers are close to what Pareto had in mind. They vary from his ratio of 80-20 percent mainly because a huge influx of penniless immigrants arrived in America at the end of the nineteenth century. The immigrants’ share of total wealth was negligible; therefore, their arrival automatically made the total holdings of wealth more unequal. In fact, this is a striking illustration of the fact that any genuine upsurge in opportunity is almost inevitably bound to lead to at least a brief surge in inequality. By 1890, immigrants accounted for about 15 percent of the total U.S. population, but more than 40 percent in some of the northeastern states, where much of the income and wealth were generated.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en2" id="text00014.html#ch08en2">2</a></sup>Adjusting for the surge in immigration, late-nineteenth-century America fit Pareto’s formula about as well as late-nineteenth-century Switzerland, where he lived.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1890 年的数字接近于帕累托的想法。它们与他的 80-20% 的比例不同，主要是因为在十九世纪末，大量身无分文的移民涌入了美国。移民在总财富中的份额可以忽略不计；因此，他们的到来自动使财富的总持有量更加不平等。事实上，这是一个突出的例子，说明任何真正的机会激增几乎不可避免地会导致至少短暂的不平等激增。到 1890 年，移民约占美国总人口的 15%，但在东北部的一些州超过 40%，而大部分的收入和财富都是在那里产生的。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en2" id="text00014.html#ch08en2">2</a></sup>在对移民潮进行调整后，十九世纪末的美国与帕累托居住的十九世纪末的瑞士一样符合帕累托的公式。</p>

            <!-- <p>The Information Age has already changed the distribution of wealth, particularly in the United States, and is one of the reasons for the bitterness of modern American politics, which we explore further in the next chapter. The Information Age requires a quite high standard of literacy and numeracy for economic success. A massive U.S. Education Department survey, “Adult Literacy in America,” has shown that as many as 90 million Americans over the age of fifteen are woefully incompetent. Or in the more colorful characterization of American expatriate Bill Bryson, “They are as stupid as pig dribble.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en3" id="text00014.html#ch08en3">3</a></sup>Specifically, 90 million American adults were judged incapable of writing a letter, fathoming a bus schedule, or adding and subtracting, even with the help of a calculator. Those who cannot make sense of an ordinary bus timetable are unlikely to be able to make much of the Information Superhighway. From this third of Americans who have not prepared themselves to join the electronic information world, an angry underclass is being recruited. At the top of society is a small group, perhaps 5 percent, of highly educated information workers or capital owners who are the Information Age equivalent of the landed aristocracy of the feudal age—with the crucial difference that the elite of the Information Age are specialists in production, not specialists in violence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>信息时代已经改变了财富的分配，尤其是在美国，这也是现代美国政治的痛苦的原因之一，我们将在下一章进一步探讨。信息时代的经济成功需要相当高标准的读写能力和计算能力。美国教育部的一项大规模调查『美国的成人识字率』表明，多达 9000 万 15 岁以上的美国人是非常无能的。或者用美国侨民比尔·布莱森（<em>Bill Bryson</em>）更多的描述，『他们像猪一样愚蠢。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en3" id="text00014.html#ch08en3">3</a></sup>特别是，9000
                万美国成年人被判定为不能写一封信，不能理解公共汽车时刻表，或者加减法，即使有计算器帮助。那些不能理解普通公共汽车时间表的人，不太可能在信息高速公路上取得很大的成就。从这三分之一没有准备好加入电子信息世界的美国人中，正在演变成一个愤怒的下层社会。在社会的顶层是一小群，也许是 5%，受过高等教育的信息工人或资本所有者，他们是信息时代相当于封建时代的土地贵族 —— 关键的区别是，信息时代的精英是生产专家，而不是暴力专家。</p>

            <!-- <p>For no very good reason, most twentieth-century sociologists have assumed that technological progress would naturally tend to produce increasingly egalitarian societies. This was not true prior to about 1750. Beginning around that time, innovative new industrial technology began to open job opportunities for the unskilled and increase the scale of enterprise. The new technology of the factory not only raised the real earnings of the poor without any effort on their part; it also tended to increase the power of political systems, making them more able to redistribute income as well as more capable of withstanding unrest. Taking a longer view, there is no inherent reason to suppose that technology always tends to mask rather than accentuate the differences in human talents and motivation. Some technologies have been relatively egalitarian, requiring contributions of many independent workers of approximately equal utility; others have put power or wealth into the hands of a few masters while most people were little more than serfs. Both history and technology have shaped different nations in different ways. The Factory Age produced one shape, and the Information Age is producing another, less violent, and therefore more elitist and less egalitarian than the one it is replacing.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由于没有很好的理由，大多数二十世纪的社会学家都认为，技术进步会自然地倾向于产生越来越多的平等主义社会。但在 1750 年之前，情况并非如此。大约从那时开始，创新的新工业技术开始为非技术工人提供就业机会，并扩大了企业的规模。工厂的新技术不仅提高了穷人的实际收入，而不需要他们付出任何努力；它还倾向于增加政治制度的力量，使其更有能力重新分配收入，也更有能力抵御动乱。从更长远的角度来看，没有任何内在的理由可以认为技术总是倾向于掩盖而不是突出人类天赋和动机的差异。有些技术是相对平等的，需要许多独立的工人做出大致相同的贡献；其他技术则将权力或财富交到少数主人手中，而大多数人不过是农奴而已。历史和技术都以不同的方式塑造了不同的国家。工厂时代产生了一种形态，而信息时代正在产生另一种形态，不那么暴力，因此比它所取代的形态更加精英化和不平等。</p>

            <!-- <p>In Otto Ammon’s view, the probable distribution of these qualities of intelligence, character, talent, and body were similar to those of scores on the dice. He went further and argued that there were, in fact, many more than four variables, and that they varied in more than six degrees. If instead of throwing four dice, one throws eight, then there are no less than 1,679,616 possible throws, yet the highest score, forty-eight, can still only be expected to occur once. The man or woman who scores very highly in all the factors that determine the place in life is much rarer than the probability of throwing four sixes would suggest; perhaps as rare as throwing eight sixes. Yet, Ammon notes, a mixture of high and low scores in these human qualities may produce “persons of unbalanced, inharmonious gifts, who, in spite of some brilliant qualities, cannot successfully meet the tests of life.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在奥托·阿蒙看来，这些智力、性格、才能和身体素质的可能分布与骰子上的分数相似。他进一步认为，事实上，存在着许多超过四个的变量，而且这些变量的变化程度超过六个。如果一个人不扔四颗骰子，而是扔八颗，那么就有不少于 1,679,616 次可能的投掷，然而最高分，即 48 分，仍然只能预期出现一次。在决定人生地位的所有因素中得分很高的男人或女人，比扔出四个 6 的概率要少得多；也许和扔出八个 6 一样少。然而，阿蒙指出，『些人的素质中的高分和低分混合在一起，可能会产生『天赋不平衡、不和谐的人，尽管他们有一些出色的素质，但却不能成功地迎接生活的考验。』

            <h3>特质与收入</h3>

            <!-- <p>Ammon then turns to the distribution of incomes. Of course, the statistics of the 1890s were much less adequate than they would be now, but German bureaucracy was already well developed, and Otto Ammon found in Saxony, Prussia, Baden, and other German states income curves that he thought were similar, both to his perceived distribution of human ability and to the probabilities of the dice. He found similar figures in Charles Booth’s <em>Life and Labour of the People of London</em> (1892). Indeed, Booth’s social distribution does look much as one might expect from Ammon’s probability theory. Booth found in London 25 percent who were poor or worse, 51.5 percent who were comfortable, and 15 percent who were well-to-do, or better; if one takes the two lowest of Booth’s categories they come to 9.5 percent. It was common before the welfare states of the twentieth century to speak of those who were least well off as the “submerged tenth.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en5" id="text00014.html#ch08en5">5</a></sup>The two highest of Booth’s categories come to 7 percent.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>阿蒙接着谈到了收入的分配问题。当然，十九世纪 90 年代的统计数据远不如现在充分，但德国的官僚机构已经很发达，奥托·阿蒙在萨克森、普鲁士、巴登和德国其他州发现了他认为与他所认为的人类能力分布和骰子的概率都相似的收入曲线。他在查尔斯·布斯的《伦敦人民的生活与劳动》（<em>Life and Labour of the People of London</em>）（<em>1892</em>）中发现了类似的数字。事实上，布斯的社会分布确实很像人们从阿蒙的概率理论中预期的那样。布斯发现，在伦敦，25%
                的人是穷人或更差，51.5% 的人是舒适的，15% 的人是富裕的或更好的；如果从布斯的两个最低类别中抽取，他们的比例为 9.5%。在二十世纪的福利国家之前，人们通常把那些最不富裕的人称为『被淹没的十分之一』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en5" id="text00014.html#ch08en5">5</a></sup>布斯的两个最高类别达到了 7%。</p>

            <!-- <p>From all this, Otto Ammon drew a number of interesting conclusions. He thought that people’s abilities, broadly defined, determined their place in society and their income. He believed that high abilities naturally result in people rising in income and social position. “Like a lonely mountain peak, or rather, like the spire of a cathedral, rise the men of high talent and of genius above the broad mass of mediocrity,…” He also believed that the “true form of the so-called social pyramid is that of a somewhat flat onion or turnip.” This turnip has a narrow stem above and a narrow root beneath. Such a social turnip is preferable as a metaphor to the social pyramid because, like modern industrial society, it has its mass in the middle while the pyramid has its mass at the bottom.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从这一切中，奥托·阿蒙得出了一些有趣的结论。他认为，从广义上讲，人们的能力决定了他们在社会中的地位和他们的收入。他认为，高能力自然会导致人们的收入和社会地位上升。『就像一座孤独的山峰，或者说，就像大教堂的尖顶，高才生和天才的人在广大的平庸者之上崛起……』他还认为，『所谓社会金字塔的真正形式是一个有点扁平的洋葱或大头菜』。这种大头菜上面有一个狭窄的茎，下面有一个狭窄的根。与社会金字塔相比，这样的社会大头菜更适合作为一种隐喻，因为与现代工业社会一样，它的质量在中间，而金字塔的质量在底部。</p>

            <!-- <h3>The Shape of the Turnip</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>大头菜的形状</h3>

            <!-- <p>Modern industrial societies are indeed all turnips, with a small wealthy and upper-professional class at the top, a larger middle class, and a minority poor class at the bottom. Relative to the middle, both the extremes are small. In modern London, if not in Washington, there are certainly more millionaires than homeless.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>现代工业社会确实都是芜杂的，顶端是少数富裕和上层职业阶层，中间阶层较大，底部是少数贫困阶层。相对于中间阶层，两个极端都很小。在现代伦敦，或是在华盛顿，百万富翁肯定比无家可归者多。</p>

            <!-- <p>All of this is intriguing, but the immediate interest of Ammon’s work lies in the major long-term shift we are experiencing in the relations, financial and political, between the top and the middle. The skills needed in the Factory Age, which is now passing, are undeniably different from those demanded by the Information Age. Most people could master the skills required for operating the machines of the mid-twentieth century, but those jobs have now been replaced by smart machines which, in effect, control themselves. A whole arena of low- and middle-skill employment has already disappeared. If we are correct, this is a prelude to the disappearance of most employment and the reconfiguration of work in the spot market.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>所有这些都很吸引人，但阿蒙的工作的直接兴趣在于我们正在经历的高层和中层之间的关系、金融和政治的重大长期转变。无可否认，正在过去的工厂时代所需要的技能与信息时代所需要的技能是不同的。大多数人都能掌握二十世纪中期操作机器所需的技能，但这些工作现在已经被智能机器所取代，这些机器实际上可以控制自己。整个中低技能的就业领域已经消失了。如果我们是正确的，这将是大多数就业的消失和现货市场工作重新配置的前奏。</p>

            <!-- <p>Something similiar would happen at the top end of the scale. In the Factory Age, the required level of high ability was perhaps 4 X 4; suppose that in the Information Age it has risen to 4 X 5.

            <!-- <p>These numbers are purely hypothetical. Obviously, we do not know what the shift in the skill requirements will be—or has already been—but there has certainly been a rise. Because of the shape of the turnip, a quite modest rise in the minimum skill requirement would put large numbers outside of a significant economic role. Equally, quite a small rise in the higher skill requirement would reduce the number of people qualified for the higher jobs very dramatically.

Frank and Philip J. Cook.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en7" id="text00014.html#ch08en7">7</a></sup>It documents the growing tendency for the most talented competitors in many fields in the United States to earn very high incomes. Equally, the opportunities for middle skills are falling; a substantial, number of low skills now fall outside the range that is rewarded with a comfortable living, though they may still find a place in small-scale services.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>确实不乏社会和政治证据表明，这种转变正在所有先进的工业社会中发生，其步伐正在加快，而且这种运动已经是一个大运动。对稀有技能的奖励已经并正在增加。传统思想家们已经不满地注意到这一点。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en7" id="text00014.html#ch08en7">7</a></sup>它记录了美国许多领域最有才华的竞争者获得非常高收入的趋势。同样，中等技能的机会也在减少；大量低技能的人现在已经超出了可以获得舒适生活的范围，尽管他们仍然可以在小规模的服务中找到一席之地。</p>

            <!-- <p>If the Information Age demands higher skills both at the top and bottom end, everyone except for the top 5 percent will be relatively at a disadvantage, but the top 5 percent will gain tremendously. They will both earn a higher share of income and keep a greater share of what they earn. At the same time, they will do a greater portion of the world’s work than ever before. Many will emerge as Sovereign Individuals. In the Information Age, the turnip of income distribution will look more as it did in 1750 than in 1950.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Societies that have been indoctrinated to expect income equality and high levels of consumption for persons of low or modest skills will face demotivation and insecurity. As the economies of more countries more deeply assimilate information technology, they will see the emergence—so evident already in North America—of a more or less unemployable underclass. This is exactly what is happening. This will lead to a reaction with a nationalist, antitechnology bias, as we detail in the next chapter.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Yet it will be the best of all for the top 10 percent of the top 10 percent, the cognitive double top. In the feudal age, it took one hundred semiskilled peasants to support one highly skilled warlord (or knight) on horseback. The Sovereign Individuals of the information economy will not be warlords but masters of specialized skills, including entrepreneurship and investment.

Without ignoring that trauma, whose dimensions we explore in greater detail later, it is important not to forget that in many areas of the globe the transition to the information economy will lead output to surge, with higher incomes all around.

In most cases, redistributed income was employed in lower-order economic activities. The effects of freeing resources from systematic compulsion will vary greatly among jurisdictions.

            <!-- <p>During the industrial period, the factor that contributed most to determining the ordinary person’s lifetime income was the political jurisdiction in which he happened to reside. Contrary to the common impression in rich economies today, income inequality rose rapidly during the industrial period. An estimate cited by the World Bank suggests that average per capita income in the richest countries ballooned from eleven times that in the poorest countries in 1870 to fifty-two times in 1985.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en9" id="text00014.html#ch08en9">9</a></sup>While inequality increased dramatically on a global basis, it often appeared otherwise to the fraction of the world inhabiting the wealthy industrial countries. Income inequality rose <em>among</em>jurisdictions rather than within them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在工业时期，决定普通人一生收入的最大因素是他碰巧居住的政治管辖区。与今天富裕经济体的普遍印象相反，收入不平等在工业时期迅速上升。世界银行引用的一项估计表明，最富裕国家的人均收入从 1870 年的 11 倍膨胀到 1985 年的 52 倍。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en9" id="text00014.html#ch08en9">9</a></sup>虽然不平等在全球范围内急剧增加，但对于居住在富裕工业国家的世界上的一部分人来说，它往往显得不一样。收入不平等在各管辖区之间而不是在各管辖区内部上升。</p>

            <!-- <p>For reasons we have already explored, the character of industrial technology itself helped assure that income gaps would narrow within jurisdictions where halfway competent governments mastered the exercise of power on a large scale. When returns to violence were rising, as they were during the Industrial Age, governments that operated on a large scale tended to be controlled by their employees. This made it effectively impossible to impose controls on the claims these governments made over resources. Their unchecked control over resources conveyed an important military advantage so long as magnitude of power predominated over the efficiency with which it was used. A not-incidental corollary of government controlled by its employees was a sharp acceleration of income redistribution. Almost every society has some provision for income redistribution, at least on a temporary basis in extraordinary circumstances. However, a close reading of the history of the provision of aid to the poor shows that “welfare” benefits tend to be more generous when poverty is minimal. Income redistribution is more likely to be curtailed when incomes for large numbers weaken. Conditions in the wealthy industrial societies in the last half of the twentieth century were almost perfect for redistributing income. This led to much higher rewards for unskilled work within these favored jurisdictions. In due course, it even provided high levels of consumption for those who did not work at all.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>由于我们已经探讨过的原因，工业技术本身的特点有助于确保收入差距在那些半路出家的政府掌握了大规模权力行使的辖区内缩小。当暴力的回报率上升时，就像工业时代那样，大规模运作的政府往往被其雇员所控制。这使得对这些政府对资源的要求实际上不可能施加控制。只要权力的大小高于权力的使用效率，他们对资源不受约束的控制就能带来重要的军事优势。政府由其雇员控制的一个并非偶然的必然结果是收入再分配的急剧加速。几乎每个社会都有一些收入再分配的规定，至少在特殊情况下是暂时的。然而，仔细阅读向穷人提供援助的历史就会发现，当贫穷程度最低时，『福利』往往更慷慨。当大批人的收入减弱时，收入再分配就更有可能被削减。二十世纪后半叶，富裕的工业社会的条件对于收入再分配来说几乎是完美的。这导致了在这些有利的管辖范围内，非技术性工作的回报要高得多。在适当的时候，它甚至为那些根本不工作的人提供了高水平的消费。</p>

            <h3>工业财富的悖论</h3>

            <!-- <p>The irony is that it was also in these jurisdictions that more people became wealthy. This apparent paradox makes perfect sense once you understand the dynamics of megapolitics explored in previous chapters. Leading sectors of the industrial economy required the maintenance of order on a large scale to function optimally. This made them particularly vulnerable to extortion by unions and governments eager to maximize the number of persons under their sway. Yet widespread redistribution of income did not totally stifle the ability of the industrial economy to function. Anyone lucky enough to be born in Western Europe, the former British settlement colonies, or Japan during the high-water period of industrialism was therefore likely to be far richer than a person of equivalent skills in South America, Eastern Europe, the late Soviet Union, Africa, and the landmass of Asia. The beneficial impact of information technology will include helping to overcome many of the obstacles to development that prevented the majority of the world’s population from enjoying many of the benefits of free markets during much of the modern period.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>具有讽刺意味的是，也正是在这些地区，更多的人变得富裕起来。一旦你理解了前几章所探讨的跨政治的动态，这种明显的悖论就完全说得通了。工业经济的主要部门需要大规模地维持秩序，以实现最佳运作。这使得他们特别容易受到工会和政府的勒索，他们渴望最大限度地增加受其支配的人数。然而，广泛的收入再分配并没有完全扼杀工业经济的运作能力。因此，任何有幸在工业化高潮时期出生在西欧、前英国定居殖民地或日本的人，都可能比在南美、东欧、苏联后期、非洲和亚洲陆地上具有同等技能的人要富有得多。信息技术的有益影响将包括帮助克服许多发展障碍，这些障碍使世界上大多数人在现代时期的大部分时间里无法享受自由市场的许多好处。</p>

            <!-- <p>As Mancur Olson has demonstrated, backwardness in the twentieth century was not due to lack of capital or specialized skills <em>per se.</em>In “Diseconomies of Scale and Development,” an essay published in 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Olson wrote, “If capital had in fact been in scarce supply in the poor countries, its ‘marginal productivity’ and so the profitability of its use ought to be greater than in the prosperous countries. The low growth rates of many countries that received nonnegligible amounts of foreign aid and the low productivity of some modern factories that were built in poor countries have further lessened the credibility of the ‘scarcity of capital’ explanation of underdevelopment.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en11" id="text00014.html#ch08en11">11</a></sup>This must be right. Had capital or skill scarcity been the main deficiency, the returns earned by both in poor jurisdictions would have been higher than in developed countries. Both skilled personnel and capital would have flooded into these regions until the returns leveled out. In fact, the opposite was often the case. There was a substantial outmigration of educated people from backward jurisdictions. And the lucky few who did manage to accumulate capital in such places exported it as rapidly as possible to Switzerland and other advanced countries.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如曼库尔·奥尔森（<em>Mancur Olson</em>）所证明的那样，二十世纪的落后并不是因为缺乏资本或专门技能本身。在 1987 年发表的《规模不经济与发展》一文中，即柏林墙倒塌前两年，奥尔森写道：『如果资本在穷国实际上是稀缺的，其「边际生产力」以及使用资本的利润率就应该比繁荣国家的大。许多接受了不可忽视的外国援助的国家的低增长率，以及在穷国建立的一些现代工厂的低生产率，进一步降低了对不发达的「资本稀缺」解释的可信度。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en11" id="text00014.html#ch08en11">11</a></sup>这肯定是对的。如果资本或技能的稀缺是主要的缺陷，那么在贫穷的管辖区，两者所获得的回报会比发达国家高。技术人员和资本都会涌入这些地区，直到收益趋于平缓。事实上，情况往往相反。有大量受过教育的人从落后的地区迁出。而少数有幸在这些地方积累了资本的人，则尽可能快地将资本输出到瑞士和其他先进国家。</p>

            <h3>更好的政府不可能被进口</h3>

            <!-- <p>Olson argues, and we agree, that the true obstacle to development in backward countries has been the one factor of production that could not be easily borrowed or imported from abroad, namely government. This is a problem that worsened as the twentieth century unfolded. In 1900, Great Britain and France, along with some other European countries, were in the business of exporting competent government to regions where indigenous powers were incapable of functioning effectively on a large scale. But shifting megapolitical conditions in the twentieth century raised the costs and lowered the returns for this activity. Colonialism, or imperialism, as it was less fondly known, ceased to be a paying proposition. Shifts in technology raised the costs of projecting power from the center to the periphery and lowered the military costs of an effective resistance. Consequently, imperial powers withdrew, or stayed on only in tiny enclaves, like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>奥尔森认为，而且我们也同意，落后国家发展的真正障碍是不容易从国外借到或进口的一个生产要素，即政府。这是一个随着二十世纪的展开而恶化的问题。1900 年，英国和法国，以及其他一些欧洲国家，都在向本土势力无法大规模有效运作的地区输出合格的政府。但二十世纪跨政治条件的变化提高了这项活动的成本，降低了收益。殖民主义，或者说帝国主义，就像它不太被人喜欢的那样，不再是一个付费的提议。技术的转变提高了将权力从中心投射到外围的成本，降低了有效抵抗的军事成本。因此，帝国主义大国纷纷退出，或只在百慕大或开曼群岛等小块飞地上留守。</p>

            <h3>新范式</h3>

            <!-- <p>The new megapolitical conditions of the twenty-first century will allow market tests to regulate outcomes in areas formerly dominated by politics. The market paradigm presupposes that results can be better regulated by rewarding desirable outcomes and penalizing undesirable ones. To be poor is undesirable, and to become rich is desirable. Therefore, incentives should reward wealth creation and encourage people to pay for the resources they consume. Life is more “fair” when people get to keep more of what they earn.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>二十一世纪新的跨政治条件将允许市场检验在以前由政治主导的领域中调节结果。市场范式的前提是，通过奖励理想的结果和惩罚不理想的结果，可以更好地调节结果。贫穷是不可取的，而致富是可取的。因此，激励机制应该奖励财富的创造，鼓励人们为他们所消费的资源付费。当人们能够保留更多的收入时，生活就更加『公平』。</p>

            <!-- <p>This is a view that will be heard more frequently in the new millennium than it was in the century now ending. Furthermore, it will be compelling as never before because it will be megapolitically founded. Capital in the Information Age is growing more mobile by the moment. The capacity to earn high income is no longer tied to residence in specific locations, as was the case when most wealth was created by manipulating natural resources. With every day that passes, it becomes easier for people using highly portable information technology to create assets that are far less subject to the leverage of violence than any form of wealth has ever been before.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在新的千年里，这种观点将比在即将结束的世纪里更经常地被听到。此外，它将比以往任何时候都更有说服力，因为它将是跨政治的基础。在信息时代，资本的流动性越来越大。赚取高收入的能力不再与居住在特定地点相联系，就像大多数财富是通过操纵自然资源创造的那样。随着时间的推移，人们利用高度便携的信息技术创造资产变得越来越容易，而这些资产受暴力影响的程度远远低于以往任何形式的财富。</p>

            <!-- <p>Arbitrary political regulations that impose costs without creating offsetting market benefits will soon be nonviable. Powerful competitive forces are tending to equalize the prices of goods, services, labor, and capital across the globe. Governments will have less latitude to impose arbitrary policies than they are accustomed to enjoy. Any government that attempts to impose more burdensome regulations on an activity than other sovereignties will simply drive that activity away. In some cases, of course, driving away unwanted activities will please the market and make those jurisdictions all the more popular and prosperous. In this sense, certain regulations may be compared to the house rules imposed by the proprietors of a hotel chain. If they prohibit people from walking barefoot or smoking in the lobby, they will no doubt lose certain customers. But turning away those customers may not cost the jurisdiction customers overall, or even reduce its total revenues. Well-shod nonsmokers may pay more precisely because barefoot smokers are excluded. Equally, regulations that make it costly or impossible to operate a rendering plant in a certain jurisdiction may drive the rendering elsewhere without depriving the jurisdiction as a whole of income.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>强加成本而不创造抵消的市场利益的武断的政治规定很快就会不可行。强大的竞争力量正趋向于在全球范围内平衡商品、服务、劳动力和资本的价格。政府强加任意政策的自由度将比他们习惯于享受的要少。任何政府如果试图对某项活动施加比其他主权国家更繁琐的规定，就会把这项活动赶走。当然，在某些情况下，赶走不需要的活动会让市场高兴，并使这些司法管辖区更受欢迎和繁荣。在这个意义上，某些法规可以被比作连锁酒店经营者的家规。如果他们禁止人们赤脚走路或在大堂吸烟，他们无疑会失去某些客户。但是，拒绝这些客户可能不会使该辖区整体上失去客户，甚至不会减少其总收入。正因为赤脚吸烟者被排除在外，不吸烟的人可能会支付更多费用。同样，使某一辖区内的渲染厂运营成本高昂或不可能的法规，可能会使渲染厂转移到其他地方，而不会剥夺整个辖区的收入。</p>

            <!-- <p>These examples demonstrate how regulations may in rare circumstances have a positive rather than a negative market value, especially in a world with a rapidly multiplying number of jurisdictions.

But the fact that all nation-states are on a death watch does not mean that they are all destined to expire at the same moment. Far from it. Devolutionary pressures will tend to be most intense in large political entities where incomes for most of the population are stagnant or falling. Jurisdictions in Latin America and Asia where per capita income is rising rapidly may endure for generations, or until lifetime income prospects there equate with those in the formerly rich industrial countries. At that point, there will no longer be easy cost-substituting gains to be had, and the politics of growth will become more challenging.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Another spur to devolution will be high indebtedness of the central government. The three wealthy industrial countries with the highest relative indebtedness—Canada, Belgium, and Italy—are not coincidentally nations with advanced separatist movements. All three countries have suffered from chronic budget deficits and now have national debts that exceed 100 percent of GDP. As the national debt has mounted in each country, the appeal of separatist movements has grown as well. In Italy, the Northern League has emerged as a dynamic and popular regional political movement. Its platform is based upon a simple mathematical observation: northern Italy, or “Padonia,” would be richer than Switzerland if large portions of its income were not siphoned off to subsidize Rome and the poorer south. The Northern League proposes an obvious solution: secede from Italy, and thus escape from some of the dire consequences of compound interest. Likewise, in Belgium, where the national debt exceeds 130 percent of GDP, the Flemings and Walloons are maneuvering like a hostile couple before a divorce. A growing minority among the Flemings argue that they are unfairly subsidizing the Walloons, and could improve their economic condition by splitting Belgium in two.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>另一个刺激权力下放的因素是中央政府的高负债率。加拿大、比利时和意大利这三个相对负债率最高的富裕工业国家，并不是巧合地拥有先进的分离主义运动的国家。这三个国家都有长期的预算赤字，现在的国债都超过了 GDP 的 100%。随着每个国家的国债增加，分离主义运动的吸引力也在增加。在意大利，北方联盟已经成为一个充满活力和受欢迎的地区政治运动。它的纲领是基于一个简单的数学观察：如果意大利北部或『帕多尼亚』的大部分收入不被抽走以补贴罗马和较贫穷的南部，它将比瑞士更富有。北方联盟提出了一个明显的解决方案：从意大利分离，从而摆脱复利的一些可怕后果。同样，在比利时，国债超过了
                GDP 的 130%，弗拉芒人和瓦隆人正在像离婚前的敌对夫妇一样进行周旋。弗拉芒人中越来越多的少数人认为，他们对瓦隆人的补贴是不公平的，并且可以通过将比利时一分为二来改善他们的经济状况。</p>

But as the federal debt and deficit mount, the realization is dawning in Quebec that this form of income redistribution will decline.

Separatist leaders also suggest that Quebec should leave Canada without shouldering a proportionate burden of the federal debt.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>加拿大的情况与之不同的是，现在鼓动分离主义的主要地区 —— 法裔加拿大，历史上一直由英裔加拿大提供补贴。但是，随着联邦债务和赤字的增加，魁北克正在意识到这种收入再分配的形式将会减少。因此，魁北克集团正在调戏它十年前所缺乏的吸引力 —— 承诺通过取消支付加拿大联邦税来提高税后收入。分离主义领导人还建议，魁北克应该离开加拿大而不承担相应的联邦债务负担。</p>

Where the potential customers are among the wealthiest persons on earth, that tendency should be all the more emphatic. Exit, or “voting with your feet,” is always an option when dated products, organizations, or even governments lose their appeal and seem to offer little prospect of immediate improvement. Consider, for example, the growth of medieval towns that served as safe havens for serfs escaping feudal subjugation. Their role may prove analogous to the role of new jurisdictions in accommodating the coming exit from nation-states. The acceptance of aliens escaping from some lord as “citizens of the pale” defied the prevailing conventions of feudal law and episcopal authority. But nonetheless it was a generally successful alternative for those who employed it, contributing importantly to weakening the grip of feudalism. As medieval historian Fritz Rorig put it, the serf of a secular lord would be “a free burgher of the town after a year and a day.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en15" id="text00014.html#ch08en15">15</a></sup>It is reasonable to expect new institutional refuges to spring up, upon “new legal principles,” to provide fiscal refuge to citizens of the state, much as the medieval town offered refuge to feudal subjects who lived within the shadows of its walls.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Information technology is rapidly diminishing many of the differences among jurisdictions, making exit a much more attractive option. Of course, “premature and excessive exits” in Hirschman’s vocabulary are understood from the point of view of what is optimal for the state being deserted.

            <p>经济学家阿尔伯特·O·赫希曼（Albert O. Hirschman）在 1969 年首次出版的《退出、谏言和忠诚》（Exit, Voice, and Loyalty）中探讨了『用脚投票』的理论微妙之处，他预见到技术进步将增加退出的可能性，作为处理衰退国家的一种策略。他写道：『只有当各国因为通信和全面现代化的进步而开始相互相似时，才会出现过早和过度退出的危险……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en16" id="text00014.html#ch08en16">16</a></sup>这正是正在发生的事情。信息技术正在迅速减少各司法管辖区之间的许多差异，使退出成为更有吸引力的选择。当然，在赫希曼的词汇中，『过早和过度的退出』是从被抛弃的国家的最佳角度来理解的。毫无疑问，中世纪欧洲的领主们认为，『他们的农奴过早和过多地退出城镇，以便在别处获得自由，使他们深受其害。』</p>

A distinct example is Ricardo’s “Equivalence Theorem,” which suggests that citizens in a country that runs huge deficits will adjust their expectations in anticipation of higher tax rates needed in the future to retire the debt. In this sense, there is an “equivalence” between financing spending by taxation and through debt. At least there was such an equivalence in the early nineteenth century when Ricardo wrote. In the Information Age, however, the rational person will not respond to the prospect of higher taxes to fund deficits by increasing his savings rate; he will transfer his domicile, or lodge his transactions elsewhere. For the same reason that producers sort among suppliers in search of the lowest costs, they will be even more strongly motivated to seek alternative suppliers of protection. The benefits of doing so will dwarf the margins to be realized by shifting to a new supplier of plastic tubes. The result to be expected is that Sovereign Individuals and other rational people will flee jurisdictions with large unfunded liabilities.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>经济学家关于行为的许多假设都植根于地方的暴政。一个明显的例子是李嘉图的『等价定理』。该定理表明，在一个有巨额赤字的国家，公民会调整他们的预期，以期待未来需要更高的税率来偿还债务。在这个意义上，通过税收和债务为支出融资之间存在着『等价』关系。至少在十九世纪初李嘉图写作时，存在着这种等价关系。然而，在信息时代，理性的人不会通过提高储蓄率来应对增加税收为赤字提供资金的前景；他将转移他的住所，或把他的交易放在其他地方。与生产者在供应商中寻找最低成本的原因相同，他们将有更强烈的动机去寻找其他保护供应商。这样做的好处将使转移到一个新的塑料管供应商所实现的利润相形见绌。可以预期的结果是，主权个体和其他理性人将退出有大量无准备金债务的管辖区。</p>

Massive transaction problems in coordinating a patchwork quilt of small firms would have effectively deautomated the assembly line. To work at all, such a system would have necessitated nonstop negotiation among the individual contractors. Instead of focusing on production, the multitude of contractors or entrepreneurs would have had to divert time and attention to fixing prices of components and working out the terms of their own constantly changing interactions.

You need only imagine the difficulty facing the designer in attempting to convince the hundreds of independent contractors on changes required to introduce a new model. In practice, almost unanimous consent would have been needed. Anyone holding out or objecting to any change in the specification of the product could either have effectively killed the model improvement or raised the cost of introducing it, thus further jeopardizing the gains from operating on a large scale.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

The auction market would certainly have been able to replace these contractors. But each succession would have required a negotiated settlement, such as a buyout of the previous operator by his replacement.

A plastic mold needed to produce a dashboard switch, for example, might have been relatively cheap, while the equipment needed to cast an engine block or stamp out the sheet metal on a fender could have cost millions. The high resource content and sequential nature of assembly-line production made problems arising from high capital costs inevitable, for reasons analyzed in the last chapter. Contractors with, capital-intensive tasks would have essentially been dependent upon the cooperation of others to amortize their investments. The ability of the contractors with higher capital requirements to raise money and operate at a profit would have depended upon their securing the cooperation of many other participants in the process whose capital costs were far lower. In many cases, they would not have gotten it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在工业时代的条件下，由独立承包商组成的装配线的另一个关键困难是，各个承包商的资本需求会有很大的不同。例如，生产仪表板开关所需的塑料模具可能相对便宜，而铸造发动机组或冲压出挡泥板所需的设备可能需要数百万美元。装配线生产的高资源含量和顺序性使得高资本成本所带来的问题不可避免，原因在上一章已经分析过。承担资本密集型任务的承包商，基本上要依靠其他人的合作来摊销他们的投资。资本要求较高的承包商能否筹集资金并实现盈利，将取决于他们能否获得资本成本低得多的其他参与者的合作。在许多情况下，他们不会得到这种合作。</p>

Those who required less money to operate their particular function on the assembly line would have gained by failing to cooperate at crucial times. Like striking workers, they could have closed down the assembly line on one pretext or another, imposing little cost on themselves but much grief to those with larger capital investments. The production process would have been subject to constant gaming, with small-scale contractors exposing those with higher capital costs to ransom through their ability to thwart output. The maneuvering of smaller contractors to extract side payments from the large would have reduced the efficiency of the system.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>对于小企业来说，有一个很大的激励机制来剥削大企业。那些需要较少资金来运作他们在装配线上的特殊功能的人，会因为在关键时刻不合作而获益。就像罢工的工人一样，他们可以以这样或那样的借口关闭装配线，对他们自己造成的损失不大，但对那些拥有较大资本投资的人来说却很痛苦。生产过程会受到不断的博弈，小规模的承包商通过阻挠产出的能力使那些拥有较高资本成本的人面临赎金。较小的承包商从大的承包商那里榨取附带费用的做法，会降低系统的效率。</p>

            <h3>坚定的解决方案</h3>

            <!-- <p>In short, many of the economies to be achieved during the industrial era by operating an assembly line on a large scale would have been dissipated if the production had been divided among multitudes of individual contractors. The single large firm was an efficient way of overcoming these drawbacks, notwithstanding its other limitations. Big business was bureaucratic. But to some extent bureaucracy and hierarchy were precisely what were required during the Industrial Age. Administrative and management teams monitored and coordinated production, with numerous middle managers passing orders down the hierarchy and other information back up the chain of command. The corporate bureaucracy also provided bookkeeping and accounting controls and minimized principal-agency problems, in which employees fail to act in the best interest of the firm that employs them. To achieve sophisticated accountancy under conditions of the Industrial Age required the work of many people. Having such an administrative bureaucracy in place was costly. It had to be paid whether production was active or slack. Because such administrators held crucial knowledge necessary to operate the business, they were usually paid a premium above what their skills would have commanded in the spot market.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>简而言之，在工业时代，如果生产被分给众多的个体承包商，那么通过大规模运营装配线所取得的许多经济效益就会被消解。 单一的大公司是克服这些缺点的有效途径，尽管它有其他的限制。大企业是官僚主义的。但在某种程度上，官僚主义和等级制度正是工业时代所需要的。行政和管理团队监督和协调生产，众多的中层管理人员将命令向下传递，并将其他信息向上反馈。公司的官僚体系也提供了簿记和会计控制，并最大限度地减少了委托代理问题，即雇员未能以雇佣他们的公司的最佳利益行事。要在工业时代的条件下实现复杂的会计，需要许多人的工作。建立这样一个行政官僚机构的成本很高。无论生产是否活跃，它都必须支付。由于这些行政人员掌握着经营企业所需的重要知识，他们的报酬通常高于他们的技能在现货市场上的价格。</p>

            <!-- <p>The large numbers of professional managers and administrators also had the drawback of tending to “capture” the firm and operate it in their own interests rather than those of the shareholders. It was not uncommon in the industrial era, for example, to find firms spending lavishly on office furnishings, club memberships, and other perks that could be enjoyed by management but that might not have generated a direct return to investors. In a complicated business, it was impossible to easily monitor from the outside which overhead expenditures were essential and which were indulgences for the employees. It was also difficult to prevent a sometimes considerable fraction of corporate employees from shirking. The fact that it was technologically difficult to monitor performance made a large middle management necessary, and at the same time made it difficult to monitor the monitors.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>大量的职业经理人和行政人员也有一个缺点，那就是倾向于『占领』公司，以自己的利益而不是股东的利益来经营公司。例如，在工业时代，公司在办公家具、俱乐部会员资格和其他可由管理层享受但可能不会给投资者带来直接回报的福利上花费巨资的情况并不少见。在一个复杂的企业中，不可能轻易地从外部监督哪些间接开支是必要的，哪些是对员工的放纵。也很难防止有时相当一部分企业员工的推诿行为。由于在技术上很难监测业绩，因此有必要建立一个庞大的中间管理层，同时也很难监测监测者。</p>

It also shared some of the characteristics of bureaucracy seen in a more exaggerated form in government offices. Orders flowed from on high. Tasks were stereotyped and compartmentalized. These tasks were often rigidly defined. Boundaries emerged among job categories, akin to those enforced by the cartels regulating the learned professions. To have expected a bookkeeper to change a burned-out lightbulb in a lamp on his desk seemed as strange to many during the Industrial Age as calling on a lawyer to help cure your flu. Employees were neither expected, nor in many cases even permitted, to cross the compartmentalized boundaries between rigidly defined functions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>“That is not my job” was a widely heard slogan that underscored the “organizational slack” of the Industrial Age. Everyone’s job was precisely defined in terms of stereotyped tasks that were not to be trespassed upon, however much that might improve productivity. Each employee in the corporate bureaucracy was hired according to “qualifications” deemed likely to predict performance in his specific function. With few exceptions, everyone was paid based upon a job classification, with more or less uniform pay throughout the organization. Because specific performance in the administrative hierarchies of Big Business often went unmeasured, as in state bureaucracies, work proceeded at a leisurely pace. So while the firm did capture the scale economies of mass production, it did so at the cost of other inefficiencies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『那不是我的工作』是一句广为流传的口号，强调了工业时代的『组织松弛』。每个人的工作都被精确地定义为陈规定型的任务，无论怎样提高生产力，都不能逾越。公司官僚机构中的每个雇员都是根据被认为有可能预测其具体职能表现的『资格』来聘用的。除了少数例外，每个人的工资都是基于工作分类，整个组织或多或少都有统一的工资。因为在大企业的行政等级制度中，具体的业绩往往是不被衡量的，就像在国家官僚机构中一样，工作以一种轻松的速度进行。因此，尽管公司确实获得了大规模生产的规模经济，但它是以其他低效率为代价的。</p>

            <!-- <p>The new megapolitical conditions of the Information Age will significantly alter the logic of business organization. Part of this is obvious. If information technology does nothing else, it dramatically lowers the cost of processing, computing, and analyzing information. One effect of such technology is to reduce the necessity of hiring large numbers of middle managers to monitor production processes. Indeed, automated machine tools made possible by advanced computational power are in many cases replacing hourly workers. And where the production process continues to be manned, the control and coordination process has largely been automated. Equipment fitted with microprocessors can monitor the progress of the assembly line much more effectively than managers ever could. Not only can the new equipment measure the speed and accuracy with which people work, it can also automatically compile accounts, and reorder components the moment they are taken out of inventory. The smallest operations can now afford financial control programs that account for their finances with greater speed and sophistication than even the largest corporations could have achieved through their production hierarchies a few decades ago.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>信息时代的新的跨政治条件将大大改变企业组织的逻辑。这其中有一部分是显而易见的。如果信息技术不做其他事情，它就会极大地降低处理、计算和分析信息的成本。这种技术的一个效果是减少了雇佣大量中层管理人员来监控生产过程的必要性。事实上，在许多情况下，先进的计算能力所带来的自动化机器工具正在取代小时工。而在生产过程继续有人的地方，控制和协调过程在很大程度上已经自动化。装有微处理器的设备可以比管理人员更有效地监控装配线的进展。新设备不仅可以测量人们工作的速度和准确性，还可以自动编制账目，并在部件从库存中取出时重新订购。最小的企业现在可以负担得起财务控制程序，这些程序对其财务的核算速度和复杂程度甚至超过了几十年前最大的公司通过其生产等级制度所能达到的程度。</p>

            <!-- <p>The fact that information technology allows for dispersed, nonsequential output of products with reduced natural resource content dramatically reduces the vulnerability to gaming and extortion, as we have already explored. However, these are not the only characteristics of information technology that make it ever more attractive to contract out functions formerly done by employees. Capital costs are lower. Product cycles are shorter. The independent contractors themselves, including the one-person firms, have vastly more sophisticated information networks at their disposal. Soon they will be able to rely upon an array of digital servants to perform a wide variety of office functions, from answering the phone to secretarial services. Digital servants will be secretaries, advertising agents, travel agents, bank tellers, and bureaucrats.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Support staff that previously absorbed a large part of the revenue generated by the principal income creators in an enterprise will be replaced by low-cost automated agents and information systems. This implies that an organization will be better able to assure itself of the highest quality of service by contracting it out, rather than by keeping the function within the firm, where it will be relatively more difficult to reward individuals for performing a task well. A virtual corporation will eliminate most “organizational slack” by eliminating the organization.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Firms grew bigger and internalized a wider range of functions because doing so allowed them to capture scale economies. Corporate bloat was also subsidized by tax laws. The high taxes that predominated in the late stages of the industrial era artificially magnified the advantages of forming a long-lived firm and hiring permanent employees. In most nations, tax laws and regulations substantially raised the costs of forming and dissolving firms on a project basis. They also have tended to force entrepreneurs to subsume independent contractors as employees. Legal interventions further temporarily inflated the supply of “good jobs” by making it costly and difficult to dismiss an employee, however little he might be contributing to the productivity of the firm.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『好工作』将成为过去。正如普林斯顿大学经济学家 Orly Ashenfelter 所说，『好工作』是一份报酬高于你价值的工作。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch08-en32" id="text00014.html#ch08en32">32</a></sup>在工业时代，由于高信息和交易成本，许多『好工作』都存在。公司的规模越来越大，并将更多的职能内部化，因为这样做可以获得规模经济。公司的膨胀也得到了税法的补贴。在工业时代晚期占主导地位的高税收，人为地放大了组建长寿公司和雇用长期雇员的优势。在大多数国家，税法和法规大大增加了在项目基础上成立和解散公司的成本。它们还倾向于迫使企业家将独立承包商归入雇员行列。法律的干预进一步暂时扩大了『好工作』的供应，使解雇雇员的成本和难度增加，无论他对公司的生产力有多大贡献。</p>

The industrial-era employees who held “good jobs” but who contributed little and relied upon fellow workers to “cover” for them will soon find themselves bidding for contracts in the spot market.

In the past there were local loyalties to place and clan and tribe, obligations, to lord or landlord, dynastic or territorial wars, but primary loyalties were to religion, God or god-king, possibly to emperor, to a civilization as such.

            <!-- <p>The trouble with this reasonable expectation is that all previous history suggests that it cannot be accommodated in a reasonable way. The transition it implies will involve a crisis. It entails a radically new way of thinking, a new imagining of community that moves beyond nationalism and the nation-state. As Michael Billig has highlighted, “our beliefs about nationhood, and about the naturalness of belonging to a nation,” are “the products of a particular historical age.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en3" id="text00015.html#ch09en3">3</a></sup>That age, the Modern Age, may already be defunct. Its predominant institutions, nation-states, still endure, but they survive precariously upon an eroded foundation. As the other shoe drops, and nation-states collapse, we expect a nasty reaction, particularly in the wealthy countries where the “national economy” brought high income to unskilled work in the twentieth century.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种合理期望的麻烦在于，所有以往的历史都表明，它无法以合理的方式被容纳。它所暗示的转型将涉及一场危机。它需要一种全新的思维方式，一种超越民族主义和领土国家的社区的新想象。正如迈克尔·比里格（<em>Michael Billig</em>）所强调的，『我们对民族性的信念，以及对属于一个国家的自然性的信念是一个特定历史时代的产物。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en3" id="text00015.html#ch09en3">3</a></sup>那个时代，即现代时代，可能已经不存在了。它的主要机构，即领土国家，仍然存在，但它们在一个被侵蚀的基础上不稳定地生存。当另一只鞋掉下来，领土国家崩溃时，我们预计会有讨厌的反应，特别是在富裕的国家，『国民经济』在二十世纪给非技术工作带来了高收入。</p>

The thesis of this book is that the massed power of the nation-state is destined to be privatized and commercialized. Like all truly radical institutional change, the privatization and commercialization of sovereignty will involve a revolution in the “common sense” of the way the world is comprehended. Such change seldom happens in a gradual, linear way. To the contrary. Indeed, for reasons we explored in <em>The Great Reckoning,</em>it is practically ruled out. We expect the Information Age to bring discontinuities—sharp breaks with the institutions and the consciousness of the past. Here is what to look for as the process unfolds:</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Indeed, many medieval European cathedrals and churches were decorated with instructive carvings of heretics having their tongues torn out by demons.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en6" id="text00015.html#ch09en6">6</a></sup>The lesson these tortures conveyed must have impressed many illiterate parishioners who could have recognized the victims as heretics simply by their punishment. The iconography was unambiguous: heretics were those whose tongues were mutilated. Yet harsh as this punishment was, it was merely the warm-up for the ultimate punishment for heresy: death at the stake.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>到十五世纪 20 年代初，数百万善良的欧洲人拒绝了天主教会的普遍权威，而就在几十年前，这会被认为是异端，是要通过酷刑和死亡来惩罚的。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en6" id="text00015.html#ch09en6">6</a></sup>这些酷刑所传达的教训一定给许多不识字的教友留下了深刻印象，他们可以通过惩罚来识别受害者是异教徒。图案是毫不含糊的：异端分子是那些舌头被割掉的人。然而，尽管这种惩罚很严厉，但它只是对异端的最终惩罚的热身而已，后面还有更残酷的
                —— 在火刑柱上死亡。</p>

            <!-- <p>To the Church’s dismay, however, the lesson was not sufficiently intimidating. The advent of the printing press inflated the supply of heretical arguments so dramatically that even the prospect of gruesome punishment ceased to deter would-be heretics. Indeed, not a few unlucky, pioneers of religious freedom in early modern Europe did pay for their assertions of spiritual independence by having their tongues cut out. Others were burned at the stake. The agents of reaction in the Inquisition literally incinerated people for uttering what we would consider ordinary expressions of conscience.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，令教会失望的是，这一教训并不具有足够的威慑力。印刷术的出现大大增加了异端论点的供应量，甚至连可怕的惩罚前景也不再能阻止潜在的异端分子。事实上，近代早期欧洲的宗教自由先驱中，确实有不少不幸的人为他们对精神独立的主张付出了代价，被割掉了舌头。其他人则被烧死在火刑柱上。宗教裁判所中的反动者们因为说出了我们认为是普通的良知表达而被焚烧。</p>

            <!-- <p>All told, the Reformation and the reaction it inspired cost millions their lives. Battlefield deaths in the final half of the Thirty Years’ War alone totaled 1,151,000.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en7" id="text00015.html#ch09en7">7</a></sup>Many more died from famine, disease, and at the hands of the Inquisition and other authorities. By no means all the violence was perpetrated by Catholic authorities. The bones of more than a thousand leading English Catholics thought to have been brutally murdered by King Henry VIII have been uncovered at the Tower of London. Some, including Sir Thomas More and Bishop St. John Fisher, were openly executed for refusing to abandon the old faith.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en8" id="text00015.html#ch09en8">8</a></sup>King Henry VIII’s Catholic daughter, Queen Mary, on the other hand, insane with syphilis inherited from her father, incinerated three hundred Protestant heretics at the stake in the last two years of her reign. Such was the price paid as individuals of different persuasions asserted their religious convictions and the long-denied right to choose the church they supported.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>总而言之，宗教改革和它所激发的反应使数百万人失去了生命。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en7" id="text00015.html#ch09en7">7</a></sup>还有许多人死于饥荒、疾病以及宗教裁判所和其他当局的手中。绝不是所有的暴力都是由天主教当局实施的。在伦敦塔中发现了一千多名被认为是被亨利八世国王残忍杀害的英国主要天主教徒的尸骨。有些人，包括托马斯·莫尔爵士和圣约翰·费希尔主教，因拒绝放弃旧信仰而被公开处决。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en8" id="text00015.html#ch09en8">8</a></sup>亨利八世的天主教女儿玛丽女王，则因从父亲那里继承的梅毒而精神错乱，在她统治的最后两年将
                300 名新教异端分子焚烧于火刑柱。这就是不同信仰的人坚持自己的宗教信仰和长期被剥夺的选择自己支持的教会的权利所付出的代价。</p>

            <!-- <p>Seen from our vantage at the end of the twentieth century, these expressions of personal belief were well within the range that should be protected by freedom of religion and freedom of speech. But there was neither freedom of religion nor freedom of speech in the early sixteenth century. The authorities of the day still drew their bearings from the waning medieval worldview. To their eyes gestures of individual autonomy in opposition to authority, especially the <em>plentitude potestatis</em> (fullness of power) of the pope were outrageous and decidedly subversive. As theological historian Euan Cameron said, religious reformers like Martin Luther adopted views that “meant a deliberate and decisive break with the institutional and spiritual continuity of the old Church.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en9" id="text00015.html#ch09en9">9</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从我们在二十世纪末的视角来看，这些个人信仰的表达完全在宗教自由和言论自由应该保护的范围内。但在十六世纪初，既没有宗教自由，也没有言论自由。当时的当局仍然从日渐式微的中世纪世界观中汲取他们的方向。在他们眼里，个人自主反对权威的姿态，尤其是教皇的 <em>plentitude potestatis</em>（权力的充实）是无耻的，是明显的颠覆。正如神学历史学家尤安·卡梅伦所说，像马丁·路德这样的宗教改革者所采取的观点，『意味着与旧教会的制度和精神延续性进行了蓄意的、决定性的决裂。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en9" id="text00015.html#ch09en9">9</a></sup></p>

            <h3>亵渎与叛逆</h3>

            <!-- <p>In that spirit, we anticipate “a deliberate and decisive break” with the institutional and ideological continuity of the nation-state. By the end of the first quarter of the next century, millions of upright individuals will have committed the secular equivalent of sixteenth-century heresy—a kind of low treason. They will have withdrawn allegiance from the faltering nation-state to assert their own sovereignty, their right to choose not their bishops or their house of worship but their form of governance as customers. The privatization of sovereignty will parallel the privatization of conscience of five centuries earlier. Both are the mass defection of former supporters of dominant institutions. As Albert O. Hirschman, an expert on “responses to decline in firms, organizations and states,” has written, this type of exit is difficult because “exit has often been branded as <em>criminal,</em>for it has been labelled desertion, defection and treason.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en10" id="text00015.html#ch09en10">10</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>本着这种精神，我们预计将与领土国家的制度和意识形态的延续性『慎重而果断地决裂』。到下个世纪的第一季度末，数以百万计的正直人士将犯下相当于十六世纪异端的世俗罪行 —— 某种低级叛国罪。他们将从摇摇欲坠的领土国家撤回效忠，以维护他们自己的主权，他们的权利不是选择他们的主教或礼拜堂，而是选择他们作为客户的治理形式。主权的私有化将与五个世纪前的良知私有化并行不悖。两者都是主导机构的前支持者的大规模叛变。正如研究『对公司、组织和国家衰退的反应』的专家阿尔伯特·O·赫希曼所写的那样，这种类型的退出是困难的，因为『退出常常被打上「犯罪的烙印」因为它被称为逃兵、叛逃和叛国。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en10" id="text00015.html#ch09en10">10</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Sovereign Individuals will no longer merely accede to what is imposed upon them as human resources of the state. Millions will shed the obligations of citizenship to become customers for the useful services governments provide. Indeed, they will create and patronize parallel institutions that will place most of the services associated with citizenship on an entirely commercial basis. For most of the twentieth century, the productive have been treated as assets by the state, in much the way that the dairy farmer treats milk cows. They have been squeezed ever more vigorously. Now the cows will sprout wings.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>主权个体将不再仅仅同意作为国家的人力资源强加给他们的东西。数百万人将摆脱公民身份的义务，成为政府提供的有用服务的客户。事实上，他们将创建和赞助平行机构，将大部分与公民身份相关的服务置于完全商业化的基础之上。在二十世纪的大部分时间里，生产者一直被国家视为资产，就像奶农对待奶牛一样。他们被压榨得越来越厉害了。现在，这些奶牛将长出翅膀。</p>

            <h3>脱离公民身份</h3>

            <!-- <p>Just as new megapolitical conditions undermined the monopoly of the Church in the sixteenth century, we expect the megapolitics of the Information Age to ultimately dictate the terms of governance in the twenty-first century, no matter how outrageous its new terms may seem to those who incorporate the values of modern politics as their own. The evolution from the status of “citizen” to that of “customer” entails a betrayal of the past as sharp as the transition from chivalry to citizenship in the early modern era. The defection of the information elite from citizenship will have a stimulus much like that which led millions of Europeans five hundred years earlier to renounce the infallibility of the pope.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如新的跨政治条件在十六世纪破坏了教会的垄断一样，我们期待信息时代的跨政治最终会决定二十一世纪的治理条件，无论它的新条件对那些将现代政治的价值观纳入自己的价值观的人来说是多么的令人愤怒。从『公民』身份到『客户』身份的演变，意味着对过去的背叛，就像现代早期从骑士精神到公民身份的转变一样尖锐。信息精英们对公民身份的背叛将产生一种刺激，就像五百年前导致数百万欧洲人放弃教皇的伟大正确一样。</p>

            <!-- <p>If the parallel with the Reformation is not compelling, it may be partly because it is not immediately evident today that renunciation of loyalty to religious institutions was ever the big deal that treason became in the twentieth century. Outside of a few Islamic countries, heresy at the end of the twentieth century is a spiritual misdemeanor, no more shattering to an individual’s reputation than a speeding ticket for driving forty-five in a thirty-mile zone.<sup><a href="#text00015.html#ch09fn2" id="text00015.html#ch09-fn2">II</a></sup>Indeed, it is not uncommon in Europe and North America to find clergy and even bishops who do not believe in God or deny crucial tenets of the faith they espouse. Today, a heresy would almost need to be blatant devil worship to be noticeable. In most Western countries, religious doctrines are so ill-formed and sloppily held that few persons can identify the theological points that were the focus of controversy of heresies in the past.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en11" id="text00015.html#ch09en11">11</a></sup>This reflects the general shift of attention away from religion.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>如果说与宗教改革的平行关系不具有说服力，部分原因可能是今天还不能立即看出放弃对宗教机构的忠诚是一件大事，而叛国罪在二十世纪就变成了大事。在少数伊斯兰国家之外，二十世纪末的异端是一种精神上的轻罪，对个人声誉的打击并不比在 30 英里的区域内开出 45 英里的超速罚单更严重。 <sup><a href="#text00015.html#ch09fn2" id="text00015.html#ch09-fn2">II</a></sup>的确，在欧洲和北美，不相信上帝或否认他们所支持的信仰的关键信条的神职人员甚至主教并不少见。今天，一个异端几乎需要是公然的魔鬼崇拜才会引人注目。在大多数西方国家，宗教教义是如此涣散和草率，以至于很少有人能辨认出过去异端邪说的争议焦点。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en11" id="text00015.html#ch09en11">11</a></sup>这反映了人们的注意力普遍从宗教转移开。</p>

            <!-- <p>To some extent, religious leaders have actually helped to lead the late-twentieth-century defection from seriousness about spiritual issues by deflecting their energies away from spiritual preoccupations to become lobbyists and social agitators. Drawn like loose filings to the magnet of power, they devote much of their activities to pressuring political leaders to adopt redistributive policies crucial to the nationalist bargain. Witness the loud efforts of the Catholic Church in Argentina to pressure the government of President Carlos Menem to abandon economic reforms in favor of conventional inflationary monetary and Keynesian fiscal policies. Similar complaints have been lodged by religious leaders against efforts to restructure bloated budgets in New Zealand and many other countries. Catholic bishops lobbied vigorously against the reform of welfare in the United States.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在某种程度上，宗教领袖实际上帮助领导了二十世纪末对精神问题的认真态度，他们把精力从精神上的关注转移到了游说者和社会煽动者身上。他们像被权力的磁铁吸引一样，将大部分活动用于向政治领导人施压，要求他们采取对民族主义交易至关重要的再分配政策。在阿根廷，天主教会大声疾呼，向卡洛斯·梅内姆总统的政府施压，要求其放弃经济改革，支持传统的通货膨胀货币和凯恩斯主义财政政策。在新西兰和其他许多国家，宗教领袖也对调整臃肿预算的努力提出了类似的抱怨。天主教主教徒大力游说，反对美国的福利改革。</p>

            <!-- <h3>A Fiscal Inquisition?</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>财政裁判所</h3>

            <!-- <p>Simply put, contemporary religious leaders focus much of their declining moral authority on secular redemption and agitation to influence the state rather than on spiritual salvation. Given this record, they can be expected to participate as accomplices in the reaction against the coming secular reformation. As the nation-state is challenged and begins to wobble, it will no longer be able to fulfill the promises of material benefits that are central to popular support. The de facto bargain struck at the time of the French Revolution will lapse. The state will no longer be capable of guaranteeing its citizens low-cost or free schooling, much less medical care, unemployment insurance, and pensions in exchange for otherwise poorly paid military service. While the changing requirements of warfare will enable governments to defend themselves and territories under their dominion without fielding mass armies, this will hardly relieve governments of the criticism for breaking what has become an anachronistic bargain.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>简单地说，当代宗教领袖将他们不断下降的道德权威大部分集中在世俗的救赎和影响国家的鼓动上，而不是在精神救赎上。鉴于这一记录，可以预期他们会作为帮凶参与到对即将到来的世俗改革的反应中。随着领土国家受到挑战并开始摇摆不定，它将不再能够履行作为民众支持核心的物质利益的承诺。在法国大革命时达成的事实上的交易将失效。国家将不再有能力保证其公民的低成本或免费教育，更不用说医疗服务、失业保险和养老金，以换取本来报酬很低的军事服务。虽然不断变化的战争要求将使政府能够在没有大规模军队的情况下保卫自己和统治下的领土国家，但这很难解除政府对打破已成为不合时宜的交易的批评。</p>

            <!-- <p>Indeed, as the new megapolitical logic takes hold, its consequences will prove wildly unpopular with the losers in the new information economy. It is therefore all but certain that many religious leaders, along with the primary beneficiaries of government spending, will be at the forefront of a nostalgic reaction seeking to reassert the claims of nationalism. They will claim that no American, Frenchman, Canadian, or other nationality—fill in the blank —should be allowed to go to bed hungry. Even countries that have been at the forefront of reform and stand to benefit disproportionately from “market-friendly globalism,” like New Zealand, will be tormented by reactionary losers. They will seek to thwart the movement of capital and people across borders. And they will not stop there. Demagogues, like Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party, are too lazy to think originally about how the new world will function. But, in due course, Winston and his crew will be tipped off to the logic of the information economy. They will seek to halt the diffusion of computers, robotics, telecommunications, encryption, and other Information Age technologies that are facilitating the displacement of workers in almost every sector of the global economy. Wherever you turn, there are politicians who will gladly thwart the prospects for long-term prosperity just to prevent individuals from declaring their independence of politics.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>的确，随着新的跨政治逻辑的确立，其后果将被证明是不受新信息经济中的失败者欢迎的。因此，几乎可以肯定的是，许多宗教领袖与政府开支的主要受益者一起，将站在怀旧反应的最前沿，寻求重新确认民族主义的主张。他们将声称，不应该让美国人、法国人、加拿大人或其他国籍的人 —— <small><u> &nbsp; &nbsp;这里请你自行填空 &nbsp; &nbsp;</u></small> —— 挨饿睡觉。即使是那些一直站在改革前沿并从『市场友好的全球主义』中获得巨大利益的国家，如新西兰，也会被反动的失败者所折磨。他们将寻求阻挠资本和人员的跨境流动。而且他们不会就此罢休。像新西兰第一党的领导人温斯顿·彼得斯这样的蛊惑者，懒得去思考新世界将如何运作。但是，在适当的时候，温斯顿和他的团队将被告知信息经济的逻辑。他们将寻求阻止计算机、机器人、电信、加密和其他信息时代技术的扩散，这些技术正在促进全球经济的几乎每个部门的工人被取代。无论你走到哪里，都会有一些政客乐意阻挠长期繁荣的前景，只是为了防止个人宣布独立于政治。</p>

The vision of the nation-state among persons of ability and wealth, the Sovereign Individuals of the future, will have undergone the political equivalent of laser surgery. They will be seeing 20/20. In the twentieth century, as throughout the modern era, persistently high returns to violence made big government a paying proposition. The decisiveness of massed power mobilized the allegiance of the wealthy and ambitious to OECD nation-states, notwithstanding predatory taxes imposed on income and capital. Politicians were able to impose marginal tax rates approaching or exceeding 90 percent in every OECD country in the decade immediately following World War II.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>As we have explored, the rich had little choice but to accede to such impositions. Circumstances obliged them to rely for protection upon governments that could master violence on a large scale. It rarely mattered, except perhaps to British policemen with the chance to take a posting to Hong Kong, that OECD governments imposed monopolistic taxes. Anyone with high earnings capacity who wished to enjoy leading-edge economic opportunity during the Industrial Age usually had little option but to reside in a high-tax economy.

            <!-- <h3>The Arithmetic of Politics</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>政治的算术</h3>

            <!-- <p>Nineteenth-century American Vice President John C. Calhoun shrewdly sketched the arithmetic of modern politics. Calhoun’s formula divides the entire population of the nation-state into two classes: <em>taxpayers,</em>who contribute more to the cost of government services than they consume; and <em>tax consumers,</em>who receive benefits from government in excess of their contribution to the cost. With a few conspicuous exceptions, most OECD entrepreneurs were net taxpayers to an exaggerated extent as the twentieth century wound down. For example, in 1996, the top 1 percent of British taxpayers shouldered 17 percent of the total income tax burden. They paid 30 percent more than the bottom 50 percent of earners, who contributed just 13 percent of income tax payments. In the United States, the rich shouldered an even more exaggerated burden, with the top 1 percent paying 30.2 percent of the total income tax receipts in 1995.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en12" id="text00015.html#ch09en12">12</a></sup>Not only were the rich obliged to pay for service that, as Frederic C. Lane reminds us, “was of poor quality and outrageously overpriced,” but their payments were often not proportionate to any service whatever.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en13" id="text00015.html#ch09en13">13</a></sup>The benefits for which the top taxpayers paid often went entirely to others. In most cases, the rich were glad to under-consume government services, which were typically of low quality. Government bureaus in almost every country were famously inefficient, largely because they tended to be controlled by employees who lacked an incentive to improve productivity. By practically any measure, the largest taxpayers during the industrial era paid many times more for government services than they would be worth in a competitive market.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>十九世纪的美国副总统约翰·卡尔霍恩（John C. Calhoun）精明地勾勒了现代政治的算术。卡尔霍恩的公式将领土国家的全部人口划分为两个等级。<strong>纳税人</strong>，他们对政府服务成本的贡献大于他们的消费；以及<strong>税收消费者</strong>，他们从政府获得的利益超过了他们对成本的贡献。除了几个明显的例外，大多数经济组织的企业家都是净纳税人，随着二十世纪的结束，净纳税人的程度越来越夸张了。例如，在 1996 年，英国最高 1% 的纳税人承担了总所得税负担的
                17%。他们比底层 50% 的收入者多支付了 30% 的税款，后者只贡献了 13% 的所得税支付。在美国，富人的负担甚至更夸张，1995 年，最高的 1% 的人支付了总所得税收入的 30.2%。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en12" id="text00015.html#ch09en12">12</a></sup>正如弗雷德里克·C·莱恩提醒我们的那样，不仅富人不得不为『质量差、价格高得离谱』的服务付费，而且他们的付款往往与任何服务都不相称。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en13" id="text00015.html#ch09en13">13</a></sup>顶级纳税人所支付的利益往往完全归于他人。在大多数情况下，富人很乐意少消费政府服务，而这些服务通常是低质量的。几乎每个国家的政府机构都是有名的效率低下，主要是因为它们往往由缺乏激励机制的雇员控制，以提高生产力。实际上，无论从哪个角度来看，工业时代最大的纳税人为政府服务支付的费用都要比在竞争性市场上的价值高出许多倍。</p>

            <!-- <p>This hardly went unnoted. Unhappily, however, the recognition that payments to government for protection were, in Lane’s words, “wasteful by ideal standards” was seldom an actionable insight in the middle of the twentieth century. Rather it was simply a defect to be accepted, “one of various kinds of waste built into social organization.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en14" id="text00015.html#ch09en14">14</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这一点几乎没有人注意到。然而，不幸的是，用莱恩的话说，认识到为保护政府而支付的费用是『按理想标准的浪费』，这在二十世纪中期很少成为可操作的见解。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en14" id="text00015.html#ch09en14">14 </a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The alternative for the discontented was not to move from Britain to France, for example, or from the United States to Canada. Except in rare circumstances, that would have availed little. The leading nation-states all suffered from the same drawback. They all adopted more or less confiscatory tax regimes. To realize a significant increase in autonomy one had to escape the core countries of Europe and North America altogether and head for the periphery. Tax burdens were meaningfully lower in parts of Asia, South America, and on various remote islands. But there was usually a price to be paid for escaping predatory taxation—a loss of economic opportunity and, often, a decline in living standards. As we have explored, in the conditions of the Industrial Age, economic opportunity was constrained and living standards were subpar in most of the jurisdictions outside the core industrial nation-states that indulged in confiscatory taxation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>对于不满的人来说，替代方案不是从英国搬到法国，比如说，从美国搬到加拿大。除了在极少数情况下，这样做没有什么用处。主要的领土国家都有同样的缺点。他们都采用了或多或少的没收性税收制度。要实现自主权的大幅提高，就必须完全退出欧洲和北美的核心国家，前往周边国家。在亚洲部分地区、南美和各种偏远岛屿，税收负担明显降低。但是，逃避掠夺性税收通常要付出代价 —— 经济机会的丧失，而且往往是生活水平的下降。正如我们所探讨的，在工业时代的条件下，在核心工业领土国家以外的大多数司法管辖区，经济机会受到限制，生活水平也不尽如人意，这些国家都沉溺于没收性税收。</p>

            <!-- <p>Consider the Communist systems as a paradigm. Along with many Third World regimes, they typically did not impose high income taxes—or even any at all.<sup><a href="#text00015.html#ch09fn3" id="text00015.html#ch09-fn3">III</a></sup>Nonetheless, during the three-quarters of a century the Soviet Union existed, few, if any, entrepreneurs sought tax refuge there. While the Soviet income tax rates were not high, they afforded no advantage because the Soviets made a virtue of their refusal to recognize property rights. This imposed an even worse burden than taxation. The Communist systems made it all but impossible to organize a business and make any serious money. In effect, the Communist state confiscated pretax income.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Further, had anyone already possessing a secure income for some eccentric reason chosen to live in Moscow or Havana, he would have been hard-pressed to use money to purchase a decent standard of living. Outside of access to good cigars, caviar, excellent orchestras, and the ballet, life in the former Communist systems afforded few consumer pleasures. Most of the scarce good things of life were unavailable or were tightly rationed on the basis of political influence rather than open exchange. At the risk of validating the stereotype of critics of postmodern life who emphasize “the importance of consumption in the postmodern experience,” the rising standard of goods and services available worldwide since the fall of Communism has surely made competition between jurisdictions more lively, thereby helping to weaken ties to nation and place.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en15" id="text00015.html#ch09en15">15</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>此外，如果有人因为某种古怪的原因已经拥有了稳定的收入而选择住在莫斯科或哈瓦那，他将很难用钱来购买一个体面的生活标准。在前共产主义制度下的生活，除了能享受到上好的雪茄、鱼子酱、优秀的管弦乐队和芭蕾舞之外，几乎没有什么消费乐趣。生活中大多数稀缺的好东西都无法获得，或者在政治影响的基础上被严格配给，而不是公开交换。冒着验证后现代生活的批评者强调『消费在后现代经验中的重要性』的风险，自共产主义垮台以来，全世界可获得的商品和服务的标准不断提高，肯定使管辖区之间的竞争更加活跃，从而有助于削弱与国家和地方的联系。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en15" id="text00015.html#ch09en15">15</a></sup></p>

It is no longer necessary to reside in a high-cost jurisdiction in order to accumulate sufficient wealth to live, as Lord Keynes advised, “wisely, agreeably and well.” For reasons we have already explored, microtechnology changes the underlying megapolitical foundation upon which the nation-state rests.

Such a society will have greater tensions between a small class, who might be termed the information aristocracy, and a growing underclass, who might be termed the information poor. One of the differences between them will be that the information poor will either be tied by geography or will find little benefit from moving. The information aristocracy, as we discuss elsewhere, will be extremely mobile, since they will be able to earn money in any locale that is attractive to them, just as popular novelists have always been able to do.

The close relationship between state power and nationalism was reflected in language. The most aggressive verb of the Modern Age was “to nationalize,” meaning to bring under state ownership and control.

            <!-- <p>Prior to the French Revolution, for example, the version of mongrelized Latin spoken in southern France, <em>la langue d’oc</em>or Occitan, had more in common with the vernacular spoken in Catalonia in northern Spain, than with <em>la langue d’oil,</em>the speech of Paris that became the basis of “French.” Indeed, when the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen” was published in the Parisian style, it was unintelligible to a majority living within the current borders of France.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en23" id="text00015.html#ch09en23">23</a></sup>One of the challenges the French revolutionaries faced was calculating how to translate their broadsides and edicts into the patois of innumerable villages that were only vaguely intelligible to one another.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>例如，在法国大革命之前，法国南部使用的混血拉丁语版本，<em>la langue d'oc</em> 或奥克西坦语，与西班牙北部加泰罗尼亚的白话语相比，与 <em>la langue d'oil</em> 成为『法语』基础的巴黎语相比，有更多的共同点。事实上，当《人与公民的权利宣言》以巴黎风格发表时，生活在法国当前边界内的大多数人都无法理解。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en23" id="text00015.html#ch09en23">23</a></sup>法国革命者面临的挑战之一是如何将他们的大字报和法令翻译成无数村庄的土语，而这些土语彼此之间只能模糊地理解。</p>

            <!-- <p>The people living within what became “France” had quite different ways of speaking that were consciously conflated into one official language as a matter of policy. Written French had been the official language of the courts of justice since François I issued the Edict of Villers-Cotterêts in 1539.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en24" id="text00015.html#ch09en24">24</a></sup>But this did not mean that it was widely intelligible, any more than “law French” was widely intelligible in England after 1200, when it became the official language of the courts of justice.

            <p>生活在后来的『法国』的人们有相当不同的说话方式，作为一项政策，他们有意识地将这些说话方式合并为一种官方语言。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en24" id="text00015.html#ch09en24">24</a></sup>但这并不意味着它能被广泛理解，就像『法律法语』在 1200 年后成为英国法院的官方语言时被广泛理解一样。每一种语言都是一种『行政白话』，而不是一种在整个领土国家上被使用和理解的标准化的语言。</p>

            <!-- <p>The French revolutionaries wanted to create something more comprehensive, a national language. Historian Janis Langins comments in <em>The Social History of Language</em>that “an influential body of opinion among the revolutionists believed that the triumph of the Revolution and the spread of enlightenment would be furthered by a conscious effort to impose a standard French in the territory of the Republic.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en25" id="text00015.html#ch09en25">25</a></sup>This “conscious effort” included a good deal of fussing over the use of individual words. Consider the telling example of the adjective “revolutionary,” first used by Mirabeau in 1789. After a period of “somewhat wide and indiscriminant use,” as Langins puts it, “during the Terror there followed a period of suppression and oblivion for several decades.… On June 12, 1795, the Convention decided to reform the language as well as the institutions created by our former tyrants i.e., the vanquished Robespierrists in replacing the word ‘revolutionary’ in official designations.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en26" id="text00015.html#ch09en26">26</a></sup>This tradition of language engineering survives in the finicky reception of the French authorities to words like “weekend” that have made their way into French from English.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>法国革命者希望创造一种更全面的东西，一种民族语言。历史学家 Janis Langins 在 <em>The Social History of Language</em> 中评论说，『革命者中一个有影响力的团体认为，通过有意识地在共和国领土国家上强加一种标准的法语，可以促进革命的胜利和启蒙运动的传播。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en25" id="text00015.html#ch09en25">25</a></sup>这种『有意识的努力』包括对个别词语的使用进行大量的推敲。考虑一下『革命』这个形容词的例子，它是由米拉波在
                1789 年首次使用的。在经过一段『有点广泛和不加区别的使用』之后，正如兰金斯所说，『在恐怖时期，出现了一段压制和遗忘的时期，持续了几十年…… 1795 年 6 月 12 日，大会决定改革语言以及我们以前的暴君所创造的机构，即，被打倒的罗伯斯庇尔主义者在官方称呼中取代了「革命」一词。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en26" id="text00015.html#ch09en26">26</a></sup>这种语言工程的传统在法国当局对从英语进入法语的『周末』等词的微妙接受中得以延续。</p>

            <!-- <p>Two centuries ago, however, the national language engineers in France were not discriminating merely against words from across the English Channel; they faced a much bigger job eradicating local variants of speech within the territory of the republic. This exercise was not merely confined to suppressing <em>la langue d’oc.</em>The “French” spoken on the Riviera then was closer to the “Italian” spoken farther to the east than to Parisian French. Equally, the language of Alsace could arguably have been categorized as a form of German, which itself had numerous local varieties. Basque was spoken in the Pyrenees. Like Breton, spoken along the northwest coast of France, Basque had little in common with any of the vernacular “dialects” of Latin that were the basis of “French.” There were also substantial numbers of Flemish speakers in the northeast. “The Parisian style of speech,” as Michael Billig reminds us, was not spread through spontaneous market processes, but “imposed, legally and culturally, as ‘French.’ ”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en27" id="text00015.html#ch09en27">27</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，两个世纪以前，法国的国家语言工程师并不只是歧视来自英吉利海峡彼岸的词汇；他们面临着一项更大的工作，即消除共和国领土国家内的地方语言变体。这项工作不仅仅局限于压制 <em>la langue d'oc.</em>，当时在里维埃拉说的『法语』与东部更远的『意大利语』相比，更接近巴黎的法语。同样，阿尔萨斯的语言可以说是被归类为德语的一种形式，而德语本身也有许多地方性品种。巴斯克语是在比利牛斯山脉说的。与法国西北海岸的布列塔尼语一样，巴斯克语与作为『法语』基础的拉丁语的任何白话『方言』没有什么共同之处。在东北部也有大量讲佛兰德语的人。正如迈克尔·比里格提醒我们的那样，『巴黎的语言风格』不是通过自发的市场过程传播的，而是『在法律上和文化上被强加为「法语」。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en27" id="text00015.html#ch09en27">27</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>What was true in France has been true elsewhere in the building of nation-states. Languages were often carried by armies and imposed by colonial powers. For example, the map of Africa after independence was defined according to the areas where the administrative languages of European powers predominated. Local dialects were seldom taught in schools. The distinctions between recognized “languages,” which tended to define “nations,” even nations with arbitrary colonial borders, and “dialects,” which did not, were in large measure political.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在法国发生的事情在其他地方的领土国家建设中也是如此。语言往往由军队携带，由殖民国家强加。例如，非洲独立后的地图是根据欧洲列强的行政语言占主导地位的地区来确定的。当地方言很少在学校里教授。公认的『语言』和『方言』之间的区别在很大程度上是政治性的，前者倾向于定义『国家』，甚至是具有任意殖民边界的国家。</p>

            <!-- <p>In short, the imposition of a “national language” was part of a process used worldwide to enhance the power of the state. Encouraging or obliging everyone within the territory where the state monopolized violence to speak “the mother tongue” conveyed significant advantages in facilitating the exercise of power.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>简而言之，强加一种『民族语言』是全世界用来加强国家权力的过程的一部分。在国家垄断暴力的领土国家上，鼓励或强迫每个人讲『母语』，在促进权力的行使方面有很大的好处。</p>

            <!-- <h3>The Military Dimension of Language Uniformity</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>语言统一的军事层面</h3>

            <!-- <p>In a world where returns to violence were rising, the adoption of a national language conveyed military advantages. A national language was almost a precondition to consolidation of central power in nation-states. Central authorities that encouraged their citizens to speak the same tongue were better able to weaken the military power of local magnates. The standardization of language after the French Revolution made the cheapest and most effective form of modern military force—national conscript armies—feasible. A common language enabled troops from all regions of the “nation” to communicate fluently with one another. This was a prerequisite before massed conscript armies could displace independent battalions mustered and controlled not by the central authorities but by powerful local magnates.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在一个回归暴力的世界里，采用一种民族语言传达了军事优势。民族语言几乎是巩固领土国家中央权力的一个先决条件。鼓励公民使用同一种语言的中央当局，能够更好地削弱地方大亨的军事力量。法国大革命后，语言的标准化使得现代军事力量的最廉价和最有效的形式 —— 国家征兵军 —— 成为可行。共同的语言使来自『国家』各个地区的军队能够彼此流畅地交流。这是在大规模的征兵军队能够取代不是由中央当局而是由强大的地方贵族召集和控制的独立营之前的一个先决条件。</p>

            <!-- <p>Prior to the French Revolution, as we discussed in Chapter 5, troops were raised and commanded by local potentates who might or might not answer calls to battle issued from Paris or another capital. In either event, their stance was determined after careful negotiation. As Charles Tilly notes, the “ability to give or withhold support afforded… great bargaining power.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en28" id="text00015.html#ch09en28">28</a></sup>Furthermore, independent military units had the additional drawback, as far as the central authorities were concerned of being capable of resisting government efforts to commandeer domestic resources. Clearly, central authorities, whether King or Revolutionary Convention, had a difficult challenge to collect taxes or otherwise strip resources from local potentates who commanded private armies capable of defending those assets.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在法国大革命之前，正如我们在第五章中所讨论的那样，军队是由地方上的权贵筹集和指挥的，他们可能会也可能不会响应从巴黎或其他首都发出的战斗号召。在这两种情况下，他们的立场都是经过仔细协商后决定的。正如查尔斯·蒂利所指出的，给予或不给予支持的能力提供了巨大的议价能力。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en28" id="text00015.html#ch09en28">28</a></sup>此外，就中央当局而言，独立的军事单位还有一个缺点，即能够抵制政府征用国内资源的行为。显然，中央当局，不管是国王还是革命公约，都很难从拥有能够保卫这些资产的私人军队的地方权贵那里收税或以其他方式剥夺资源。</p>

            <!-- <p>“National armies” greatly enhanced the power of the national government to impose its will throughout a territory. Imposition of a national language played a decided role in facilitating the formation of national armies. Before national armies could form and function effectively it was obviously useful that their various members be able to communicate fluently.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『国家军队』大大增强了政府在整个领土国家上强加其意志的权力。国家语言的强加在促进国家军队的形成方面起到了决定性的作用。在国家军队能够有效地形成和运作之前，其各成员能够流畅地交流显然是有益的。</p>

            <!-- <p>It was therefore a military plus if everyone within a jurisdiction could comprehend orders and instructions, as well as convey certain intelligence back along the bureaucratic chain of command. The French revolutionaries demonstrated the value of this almost immediately. In addition to running the equivalent of a language school, they also set up special monthlong “crash courses” in which, as Langins writes, “hundreds of students from all over France would be trained in the techniques of gunpowder and cannon manufacture.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en29" id="text00015.html#ch09en29">29</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，如果一个辖区内的每个人都能理解命令和指示，并能沿着官僚的指挥系统传递某些情报，那就是军事上的一大优势。法国革命者几乎立即证明了这一点的价值。除了开办相当于语言学校的课程外，他们还专门开设了为期一个月的『速成班』，正如兰金斯所写的那样，『来自法国各地的数百名学生将接受火药和大炮制造技术的培训。』<sup><a《 href="#text00023.html#ch09-en29" id="text00015.html#ch09en29">29</a</sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The military advantage of the French approach was shown by their successes in the Napoleonic period, as well as by contrary examples of what happened to regimes that could not depend upon the mobilization benefits of a common tongue during war. One of many factors that contributed to the disastrous defeats and demoralization of the Russian forces in the early days of World War I was the fact that the czar’s aristocratic officer corps tended to communicate in German (the other court language of the Romanovs was French), which the rank-and-file troops, not to mention the citizenry, did not understand.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>法国人的做法在军事上的优势表现在他们在拿破仑时期的成功，以及相反的例子，即，那些在战争期间在不能依靠同一种语言的动员效益的政权所发生的事情。在第一次世界大战初期，造成俄国军队灾难性失败和士气低落的许多因素之一是，沙皇的贵族军官团倾向于用德语交流（罗曼诺夫家族的另一种宫廷语言是法语），而普通部队，更不用说公民了，根本不懂德语。</p>

            <!-- <p>This points to another important military advantage of a common language. It reduces the motivational hurdles to fighting a war. Propaganda is useless if incomprehensible. In this respect as well, the French revolutionaries were also well attuned to the possibilities. Their “dominant idea,” according to Langins, was “the will of the people.… They therefore had to identify themselves with the popular will by <em>expressing</em>it in its own particular language.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en30" id="text00015.html#ch09en30">30</a></sup>Prior
to 1789, mutual incomprehensibility among “citizens” was a drawback in expressing the “will of the people” and thus a check on the exercise of power at the national level. In more ways than one, multilingual states and empires faced higher
obstacles in mobilizing for war during the industrial period.</p>
<span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这指出了共同语言的另一个重要军事优势。它减少了打仗的动力障碍。如果无法理解，宣传是没有用的。在这方面，法国革命者也很好地适应了这种可能性。兰金斯说，他们的『主导思想』是『人民的意志…… 因此他们必须通过用自己的特殊语言来表达人民的意志来认同自己。』 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en30" id="text00015.html#ch09en30">30</a></sup>在 1789 年之前，『公民』之间的相互不理解是表达『人民的意志』的一个缺点，因此也是对国家层面权力行使的一种制约。在工业化时期，多语言国家和帝国在动员战争方面面临更多的障碍。</p>

            <!-- <p>At the margin, therefore, they tended to be supplanted by nation-states that were better able to motivate their citizens to fight and mobilize resources for war. This is exemplified by nationalist consolidation, such as the invention of France and the French at the end of the eighteenth century. It is also illustrated by cases of nationalist devolution, such as the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after World War I. The new nation-states that emerged in the wake of the Hapsburg Empire—Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia—were, as Keynes said, “incomplete and immature.” Yet their claims to form independent nation-states grouped around national identities at least partly defined by language persuaded Woodrow Wilson and other Allied leaders drawing up the Treaty of Versailles.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，在边缘地带，它们往往被那些能够更好地激励其公民进行战斗和调动战争资源的领土国家所取代。民族主义的巩固就是一个例子，例如在十八世纪末发明的法国和法国人。它也被民族主义演变的案例所说明，如第一次世界大战后奥匈帝国的崩溃。哈布斯堡帝国之后出现的新领土国家 —— 奥地利、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和南斯拉夫，正如凯恩斯所说，『不完整和不成熟』。然而，他们围绕着至少部分由语言定义的民族身份而形成的独立领土国家的主张，说服了伍德罗·威尔逊和其他起草《凡尔赛条约》的盟国领导人。</p>

            <!-- <p>The carving up of Central Europe after World War I illustrates what a double-edged sword language became in state-building. When returns to violence were rising, a common tongue facilitated the exercise of power and consolidated jurisdictions. However, when incentives to consolidate were weaker, factions formed by minorities around language disputes also tended to fracture multilingual states. The surge of separatist sentiment in the cities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the mid-nineteenth century followed epidemics that devastated the German-speaking populations. Prague was a German-speaking city when the nineteenth century opened. Like other cities, it grew rapidly as the century unfolded, mostly by migration, as vast numbers of landless Czech-speaking peasants were assimilated from the countryside. In the beginning, the newcomers found it necessary to learn German in order to get along, so they did. But when famine and disease carried away large numbers of German-speaking urban residents in midcentury, they were replaced by Czech-speaking peasants. Suddenly there were so many Czech speakers that it was no longer essential for the new residents to learn German. Prague became a Czech-speaking city and a hotbed of Czech nationalism.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>第一次世界大战后对中欧的瓜分说明了语言在国家建设中是一把双刃剑。当暴力的回报率上升时，共同的语言促进了权力的行使并巩固了管辖权。然而，当巩固的动机较弱时，少数民族围绕语言争端形成的派别也往往会使多语言国家分裂。十九世纪中期，奥匈帝国各城市的分离主义情绪激增，随之而来的是流行病对讲德语的人口造成的破坏。十九世纪初，布拉格是一个讲德语的城市。与其他城市一样，随着本世纪的展开，它迅速发展，主要是通过移民，因为大量没有土地的捷克语农民从农村被同化。一开始，新来的人发现有必要学习德语，以便相处，所以他们这样做了。但在本世纪中叶，饥荒和疾病带走了大量讲德语的城市居民，他们被讲捷克语的农民所取代。突然间，讲捷克语的人多了起来，新居民不再需要学习德语了。布拉格成为一个讲捷克语的城市，也成为捷克民族主义的温床。</p>

            <!-- <p>Contemporary separatist movements now frequently form around language disputes in multilingual countries. This is evidently the case in Belgium and Canada, two nations that, as we noted earlier, will probably be among the first in the OECD to dissolve in the new millennium. Few governments can top the heavy-handed actions to enforce language uniformity imposed by the Parti Québecois in Quebec.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en31" id="text00015.html#ch09en31">31</a></sup>More surprisingly, language grievances also played a role in launching the early activities of the northern separatists in Italy, which also faces disintegration. In the early 1980s, the Lombard League, as it was then known, “declared Lombardian to be a separate language from Italian.” Billig comments, “Had the League’s programme been successful during the early 1980s, and had Lombardy seceded from Italy, establishing its own state boundaries, a prediction might be made: increasingly Lombardian would have come to be recognized as different from Italian.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en32" id="text00015.html#ch09en32">32</a></sup>This is not an arbitrary assertion. It reflects what has happened in similar cases. For example, after Norway became independent in 1905, Norwegian nationalists set about a concerted effort to identify and underline features of the “Norwegian language” that were distinct from Danish and Swedish. Similarly, activists favoring an independent Belarus changed road signs into “Belarusian,” but apparently failed to make the point that Belarusian is a separate language rather than a dialect of Russian.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当代分离主义运动现在经常围绕着多语言国家的语言争端而形成。比利时和加拿大的情况显然如此，正如我们之前指出的那样，这两个国家可能会成为 OECD 中首批在新千年中解体的国家。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en31" id="text00015.html#ch09en31">31</a></sup>更令人惊讶的是，语言上的不满也在意大利北方分离主义者的早期活动中发挥了作用，意大利也面临解体。在二十世纪 80 年代初，伦巴第联盟，正如它当时所知道的那样，『宣布伦巴第语是一种独立于意大利语的语言』。Billig
                评论说：『如果联盟的方案在二十世纪 80 年代初获得成功，并且伦巴第从意大利分离出来，建立了自己的国家边界，就可以做出预测：越来越多的伦巴第语将被承认为不同于意大利语。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en32" id="text00015.html#ch09en32">32</a></sup>这不是一个随意的断言。它反映了在类似情况下发生的情况。例如，在挪威于 1905 年独立之后，挪威民族主义者就开始一致努力，以确定和强调『挪威语言』有别于丹麦语和瑞典语的特点。同样，支持独立的白俄罗斯的活动家将路标改为『白俄罗斯语』，但显然没有说明白俄罗斯语是一种独立的语言，而不是俄语的一种方言。</p>

            <!-- <p>Now that the military imperatives favoring language uniformity have largely been outstripped, we expect the national languages to fade, but not without a fight. It is to be expected that the well-rehearsed adage that “war is the health of the state” will be tested as a recuperative. As the nation-state slides into irrelevancy, demagogues and reactionaries will foment wars and conflicts, along the lines of ethnic and tribal fighting that has racked the former Yugoslavia and numerous jurisdictions in Africa, from Burundi to Somalia. Conflicts will prove convenient for the pretexts they provide for those seeking to arrest the trend toward commercialization of sovereignty. Wars will facilitate efforts to sustain more exacting regimes of taxation and impose more severe penalties for escaping the duties and burdens of citizenship. Wars will help undergird the “them, and us” dimension of nationalism. To the proponents of systematic coercion, commercialized sovereignty, which gives individuals a choice of sovereignty services based upon price and quality, will seem no less a sin than the assertion by individuals of the right to veto the judgments of the pope and choose their own path to salvation during the Reformation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>现在，支持语言统一的军事需要在很大程度上已被超越，我们预计民族语言将逐渐消失，但不是没有斗争。可以预见的是，『战争是国家的健康』这句排练好的格言将作为一种休养生息的手段受到考验。随着领土国家滑向无足轻重的境地，煽动者和反动派将沿着蹂躏前南斯拉夫和非洲许多地区（从布隆迪到索马里）的种族和部落斗争的路线，煽动战争和冲突。冲突将被证明是方便的，因为它们为那些试图阻止主权商业化的趋势的人提供了借口。战争将有助于维持更严格的税收制度，并对逃避公民责任和负担的行为施加更严厉的惩罚。战争将有助于巩固民族主义的『他们』和『我们』的层面。对于系统性胁迫的支持者来说，商业化的主权，即让个人根据价格和质量选择主权服务，似乎与宗教改革期间个人主张否决教皇的判决并选择自己的救赎之路一样，都是一种罪恶。</p>

            <!-- <p>The parallel is underscored by the fact that both the new technology of printing at the end of the fifteenth century and the new information technology at the end of the twentieth place formerly occult knowledge at the disposal of individuals in a liberating way. The printing press brought the Scriptures and other holy texts directly within the reach of individuals who previously had to rely upon priests and the church hierarchy to interpret the Word of God. The new information technology brings within the reach of anyone with a computer hook-up information about commerce, investment, and current events that previously was available only to persons at the pinnacle of government and corporate hierarchies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>十五世纪末的新印刷技术和二十世纪末的新信息技术都将以前的神秘知识以一种解放的方式交给个人使用，这一事实强调了这种相似性。印刷机将圣经和其他圣典直接带到个人手中，而这些人以前必须依靠牧师和教会等级制度来解释上帝的话语。新的信息技术使任何有电脑连接的人都能获得有关商业、投资和时事的信息，而这些信息以前只有政府和公司高层的人才能获得。</p>

As the comment from William Pfaff quoted at the head of this chapter suggests, it is ahistorical and wrong to think that loyalties to the land of one’s fathers, the <em>patria,</em>necessarily entails loyalty to an institution resembling a nation-state. Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M. Smith make this even more clear in <em>The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century,</em>showing that what appear to be examples of early modern nationalism are more often instances of patriots defending a much narrower <em>patria</em>—often against the encroachment of a state. They write, “All too often a supposed allegiance to a national community turns out, on inspection, to be nothing of the kind. The <em>patria</em>itself is at least as likely to be a home town or province as the whole nation.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en34" id="text00015.html#ch09en34">34</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这些新媒体将通过创造超越地理边界的新亲和力来削弱民族主义。它们将吸引广泛分散的受众，无论受过教育的人碰巧在哪里找到他们。这些新的非地域性的亲和力将蓬勃发展，并在此过程中帮助创造一个新的『爱国主义』焦点。或者说，它们将形成新的『群体』，个人可以在不一定牺牲其经济理性的情况下与之认同。犹太人在过去两千年的历史表明，从长远来看，在面对敌对的地方条件时，这是有可能的。正如本章开头引用的威廉·普法夫（<em>William Pfaff</em>）的评论所表明的那样，认为对自己祖先的土地，即
                <em>patria</em> 的忠诚必然意味着对类似于领土国家的机构的忠诚是不符合历史的，也是错误的。杰弗里·帕克和莱斯利·M·史密斯在《十七世纪的普遍危机》中更清楚地说明了这一点，他们指出，那些看起来是现代早期民族主义的例子，更多的时候是爱国者在捍卫一个更狭窄的<em>patria</em>—— 通常是为了对抗一个国家的侵袭。他们写道：『所谓对民族共同体的效忠，往往在检查后发现根本不是那么回事。<em>patria</em> 本身至少和整个国家一样可能是一个家乡或省份。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en34" id="text00015.html#ch09en34">34</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>As Jack Weatherford lucidly explains in <em>Savages and Civilization,</em>the rise of the printing press, the first mass-production technology, had dramatic effects in contributing to the creation of politics, with its demands for allegiance to a broader nation-state. By the year 1500, there were printing presses operating in 236 places in Europe. “and they had printed a combined total of some 20 million books.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en35" id="text00015.html#ch09en35">35</a></sup>Gutenberg’s first printed book was an edition of the Bible in Latin. He followed it with editions of other popular medieval books in Latin. As Weatherford explains, printing meandered in a direction that defeated early expectations that the ready availability of texts would spread the use of Latin and even Greek. To the contrary. There were two important reasons why the printing press did not reinforce the use of Latin. First, the printing press was a mass-production technology. As Benedict Anderson points out, “If manuscript knowledge was scarce and arcane lore, print knowledge lived by reproducibility and dissemination.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en36" id="text00015.html#ch09en36">36</a></sup>Very few Europeans were multilingual in 1500. This meant that the audience for works in Latin was not a mass audience. The vast majority who were monoglot made up a much bigger market of potential readers. Furthermore, what was true of readers was even more true of writers. Publishers needed products to sell. Because there were few contemporary fifteenth- or sixteenth-century authors who could compose satisfactory new works in Latin, publishers were driven by market necessity to publish works in the vernacular. Printing thus helped to differentiate Europe into linguistic subsets. This was encouraged not only by the publication of new works that established the identity of new languages, like Spanish and Italian, but also by the adoption of characteristic typefaces, such as Roman, Italic, and the heavy Gothic script that was common to German publishing until well into the twentieth century. The new vernacular publishing, what Anderson describes as “print capitalism,” was very successful. Most notably, the printing press gave heresy the kind of decisive boost that we expect for the denationalization of the individual from the Internet. In particular, Luther became “the first best-selling author so known. Or to put it another way, the first writer who could ‘sell’ his new books on the basis of his name.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en37" id="text00015.html#ch09en37">37</a></sup>Astonishingly, Luther’s works accounted for “no less than one third of <em>all</em>German-language books sold between 1518 and 1525.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en38" id="text00015.html#ch09en38">38</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如杰克·韦瑟福德（<em>Jack Weatherford</em>）在《野蛮人与文明》（<em>Savages and Civilization</em>）一书中清晰地解释的那样，作为第一种大规模生产技术，印刷机的兴起对政治的产生产生了巨大的影响，因为它要求人们效忠于更广泛的领土国家。到 1500 年，欧洲有 236 个地方有印刷厂在运作。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en35" id="text00015.html#ch09en35">35</a></sup>古腾堡的第一本印刷品是一本拉丁文版的《圣经》。随后，他又用拉丁文出版了其他流行的中世纪书籍。正如韦瑟福德所解释的那样，印刷术的发展方向打破了早期的期望，即文本的随时可得将使拉丁语甚至是希腊语的使用得到普及。可事实恰恰相反。印刷机没有加强拉丁语的使用，有两个重要原因。首先，印刷术是一种大规模生产技术。正如本尼迪克特·安德森所指出的，『如果说手稿知识是稀缺的、神秘的传说，那么印刷知识则是靠可复制性和传播性生存的。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en36" id="text00015.html#ch09en36">36</a></sup>1500
                年很少有欧洲人使用多种语言。这意味着拉丁文作品的受众并不是大众读者。绝大多数人都是单语者，他们构成了一个更大的潜在读者市场。此外，对读者如此，对作家更是如此。出版商需要产品来销售。由于当代十五或十六世纪的作家很少能用拉丁文创做出令人满意的新作品，出版商受市场需要的驱使，用白话文出版作品。因此，印刷有助于将欧洲区分为不同的语言子集。这不仅受到了出版新作品的鼓励，这些作品确立了新语言的身份，如西班牙语和意大利语，而且还受到了采用特色字体的鼓励，如罗马体、斜体和德国出版业常见的沉重的哥特式字体，直到二十世纪。新的乡土出版，即安德森所说的『印刷资本主义』，是非常成功的。最值得注意的是，印刷术给异端带来了决定性的推动力，我们期望从互联网上获得对个人的非国家化。特别是，路德成为第一个如此出名的畅销书作者。或者换一种说法，第一个『可以凭自己的名字卖出新书的作家』。
                <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en37" id="text00015.html#ch09en37">37</a></sup>令人吃惊的是，路德的作品在 1518 年至 1525 年间售出的所有德语书籍中占了不少于三分之一。</p>

            <!-- <p>In many respects, the new technology of the Information Age will counter part of the megapolitical impact of fifteenth-century technology, the printing press, in stimulating and underpinning the rise of nation-states. The World Wide Web creates a commercial venue with a global language, English. It will eventually be reinforced with simultaneous-translation software, making almost everyone effectively multilingual, and helping to denationalize language and imagination. Just as the technology of the printing press undermined allegiance to the dominant institution of the Middle Ages, the Holy Mother Church, so we expect the new communications technology of the Information Age to undermine the authority of the nanny state. In due course, almost every area will become multilingual. Local dialects will rise in importance.

            <h2>军事迷信主义</h2>

            <!-- <p>Far from being objective communities, in the same sense that, for example, “hunting-gathering bands” are objective, nations are imagined out of a mysticism inspired by a defunct military imperative. That was the imperative to link every person living within a territory through a sense of identity that can be made to seem more important than life itself. As Kantorowicz noted, it is not a coincidence that “at a certain moment in history the state in the abstract or the state as a corporation appeared as a corpus mysticism and that death for this new mystical body appeared equal in value to the death of a crusader for the cause of God!”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en39" id="text00015.html#ch09en39">39</a></sup>In this sense, the nation-state can, be understood as a mystical construct. Yet as Billig notes, nationalism is “a banal mysticism, which is so banal that all the mysticism seems to have evaporated long ago.” It “binds ‘us’ to the homeland—that special place which is more than just a place, more than a mere geophysical area. In all this, the homeland is made to look homely, beyond question and, should the occasion arise, worth the price of sacrifice. And men, in particular, are given their special, pleasure-saturated reminders of the possibilities of sacrifice.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en40" id="text00015.html#ch09en40">40</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>就像『狩猎队』是客观的一样，国家远不是客观的社区，而是由一种神秘主义激发出来的，这种神秘主义来自于一种已经失效的军事要求。那就是通过一种可以被认为比生命本身更重要的身份感，将生活在一个领土国家内的每个人联系起来。正如 Kantorowicz 所指出的，『在历史上的某个时刻，抽象的国家或作为公司的国家出现了一个神秘主义的躯体，而且这个新的神秘主义躯体的死亡在价值上似乎等同于上帝事业的十字军战士的死亡。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en39" id="text00015.html#ch09en39">39</a></sup>在这个意义上，领土国家可以被理解为一种神秘主义的构造。然而，正如
                Billig 所指出的，民族主义是『一种平庸的神秘主义，它是如此平庸，以至于所有的神秘主义似乎早就蒸发了』。它将『我们』与『祖国』 —— 那个特殊的地方联系在一起，它不仅仅是一个地方，不仅仅是一个地球物理区域。在这一切中，祖国被认为是家常便饭，毋庸置疑，如果出现这种情况，值得牺牲。而男人，特别是，被赋予了他们特殊的、充满快感的对牺牲的可能性的提醒。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en40" id="text00015.html#ch09en40">40</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>The imaginative link between the nation and home continues to be highlighted by nationalists at every opportunity. As Billig suggests, the nation is “imagined as homely space, cozy within its borders, secure against the dangerous outside world. And ‘we’ the nation within the homeland can so easily imagine ‘ourselves’ as some sort of family.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en41" id="text00015.html#ch09en41">41</a></sup>The clichés of nationalism, tirelessly and routinely repeated, include many commonplace metaphors of kinship and identity. They associate the nation with an individual’s sense of “inclusive fitness,” a powerful motive for altruism and sacrifice.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>民族和家园之间富有想象力的联系继续被民族主义者利用一切机会强调。正如 Billig 所说，『国家被想象成家庭式的空间，在其边界内舒适地生活，安全地抵御危险的外部世界。而「我们」这个民族在家园里可以很容易地把「我们自己」想象成某种家庭。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en41" id="text00015.html#ch09en41">41</a></sup>民族主义的陈词滥调，不知疲倦地经常重复，包括许多普通的亲属关系和身份隐喻。他们将国家与个人的『包容性适应』意识联系在一起，这是利他主义和牺牲的强大动机。</p>

            <!-- <p>Our main focus in this book is on objective “megapolitical” factors that alter the costs and rewards of human choices. The underlying premise upon which the predictive power of the analysis rests is that individuals will seek rewards and shun costs. This is an essential truth of what Charles Darwin called “the economy of nature.” But it is not the whole truth. Simple reward optimization does not explain everything in life. However, it does illuminate two of the three main forms of human sociality, identified by Pierre Van Den Berghe as “reciprocity and coercion.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en43" id="text00015.html#ch09en43">43</a></sup>By “reciprocity” Van Den Berghe means “cooperation for mutual benefit.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en44" id="text00015.html#ch09en44">44</a></sup>The most complex and far-reaching examples of reciprocity are market interactions: trading, buying, selling, producing, and other economic activities. “Coercion is the use of force for one-sided benefit, that is, for purposes of intra-specific parasitism or predation.” <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en45" id="text00015.html#ch09en45">45</a></sup>As we have explored in this volume and two previous books, we believe that coercion is a crucial element in human society, a larger one than is usually recognized. Coercion helps determine the security of property and limits the ability of individuals to enter into mutually beneficial cooperation. Coercion underlies all politics. The third element in Van Den Berghe’s typology of human sociality is “kin selection,” the cooperative behavior that animals undertake with their kin. Kin selection, which is described more fully below, is also a crucial feature of the “economy of nature.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>我们在本书中主要关注的是改变人类选择的成本和回报的客观『跨政治』因素。分析的预测能力所依赖的基本前提是，个人将寻求回报并回避成本。这是查尔斯·达尔文所说的『自然经济』的一个基本真理。但这并不是全部的真理。简单的奖励优化并不能解释生活中的一切。然而，它确实阐明了人类社会性的三种主要形式中的两种，被皮埃尔·范登贝尔赫确定为『互惠和胁迫』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en43" id="text00015.html#ch09en43">43</a></sup>范登贝尔赫所说的『互惠』是指『互利的合作』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en44" id="text00015.html#ch09en44">44</a></sup>互惠的最复杂和最深远的例子是市场互动：交易、购买、销售、生产和其他经济活动。『胁迫』是为了片面的利益而使用武力，即为了特定的内部寄生或掠夺的目的。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en45" id="text00015.html#ch09en45">45</a></sup>正如我们在本卷和前两本书中所探讨的那样，我们认为胁迫是人类社会的一个关键因素，比人们通常认识的要大。胁迫有助于决定财产的安全，并限制个人进行互利合作的能力。胁迫是所有政治的基础。范登贝格的人类社会性类型学中的第三个要素是『亲属选择』，即动物与它们的亲属进行的合作行为。下文将更全面地描述亲属选择，这也是『自然经济』的一个重要特征。</p>

For example, Why do we sometimes observe sex and families, sometimes sex without families, sometimes neither sex nor families? Why do some animals flock, others remain solitary? Within groups, why do we sometimes observe hierarchical dominance patterns, sometimes not? Why do organisms in some species partition territories, others not? What determines the selflessness of the social insects, and why is this pattern so rare in Nature? When do we see resources allocated peacefully, when by means of violence? These are questions both posed and answered in recognizably economic terms. Sociobiologists ask what are the net advantages of the observed association patterns to the organisms displaying them, and what are the mechanisms whereby these patterns persist in social equilibrium states. It is perhaps this assertion of <em>economic-behavioural continuity</em>between man and other life-forms (termed “genetic capitalism” by one detractor) that explains the hostility of some ideologues to sociobiology…<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en46" id="text00015.html#ch09en46">46</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

If we think of cultures in this way, we shall see them as parallel to genetic development. The three great differences are that cultures are transmitted by the information chain between human beings, not by the genetic chain between generations; they can to some extent—perhaps less than we think—be changed by conscious intelligent action; they change with the prevailing environment of costs and rewards, which mutates much faster than genetic change.

            <h3>进化模型</h3>

            <!-- <p>There are two biological models of the way in which species evolve. The scientific orthodoxy is neo-Darwinist. Random genetic changes produce different physical forms. Most of these forms have no advantage to survival, as for instance the albino blackbird, and these tend to the out. A small number of them are helpful to survival and spread through the species. There are still many difficulties in this theory, which may be sorted out by scientists in the next century, but randomness and the survival of favorable adaptations are the current scientific orthodoxy and have some explanatory power. The alternative is some variant of the theory of the early twentieth century French philosopher Henri Bergson, who believed that nature had some nonrandom creative purpose, an intelligent force seeking solutions. This concept has echoes in the work of such contemporary authorities as David Layzer and Stephen Jay Gould, who have stressed that genetic variation is not simply random but shows definite propensities.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en50" id="text00015.html#ch09en50">50</a></sup>This is not creationism in its strict biblical sense, but it avoids many of the problems of orthodox Darwinism.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>关于物种进化的方式，有两种生物学模式。科学的正统观念是新达尔文主义。随机的遗传变化产生不同的物理形式。这些形式中的大多数对生存没有好处，例如白化黑鸟，它们往往被淘汰。其中一小部分对生存有帮助，并在物种中传播。这一理论仍有许多困难，科学家们可能会在下个世纪解决这些问题，但随机性和有利的适应性的生存是目前科学的正统观念，具有一定的解释力。另一个选择是二十世纪初法国哲学家亨利·柏格森的理论的一些变体，他认为自然界有一些非随机的创造性目的，是一种寻求解决方案的智能力量。这一概念在大卫·雷泽和斯蒂芬·杰·古尔德等当代权威人士的工作中得到了回应，他们强调遗传变异不是简单的随机性，而是显示出明确的倾向性。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en50" id="text00015.html#ch09en50">50</a></sup>这不是严格圣经意义上的创造论，但它避免了许多正统达尔文主义的问题。</p>

            <!-- <p>The biological perspective on human behavior was enhanced by the introduction of the concept of “inclusive fitness” in 1963 by W. D. Hamilton in “The Evolution of Altruistic Behavior.” Hamilton recognized that while humans are fundamentally given to self-oriented behavior, they also undertake occasional acts of altruism or self-sacrifice that offer no apparent benefits in terms of the life of the individual. Hamilton sought to reconcile these apparent contradictions by positing that the fundamental maximizing unit is not the individual organism but the gene. Individuals in any species will seek to maximize not simply their own personal well-being but what Hamilton called their “inclusive fitness.” He argued that “inclusive fitness” involves not only personal survival in the Darwinian sense, but also the enhanced reproduction and survival of close relatives who share the same genes.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en52" id="text00015.html#ch09en52">52</a></sup>Hamilton’s “inclusive fitness” thesis helps illuminate many otherwise curious features of human societies, including aspects of politics in nation-states.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1963 年，W.D. Hamilton 在《利他行为的进化》中提出了『包容性适应』的概念，使人类行为的生物学观点得到加强。汉密尔顿认识到，虽然人类从根本上说是以自我为导向的行为，但他们也偶尔会采取利他主义或自我牺牲的行为，这些行为对个人的生活没有明显的好处。汉密尔顿试图调和这些明显的矛盾，认为基本的最大化单位不是个体有机体，而是基因。任何物种中的个体都会寻求最大化，不仅仅是他们自己的个人福祉，而是汉密尔顿所称的『包容性适应』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en52" id="text00015.html#ch09en52">52</a></sup>汉密尔顿的『包容适应性』理论有助于阐明人类社会的许多其他奇怪的特征，包括领土国家政治的各个方面。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Altruism: Misnomer or Fossil Kin Selection?</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>利他主义</h3>

            <!-- <p>According to Van Den, Berghe, “Altruism, then, is directed mostly at kin, especially at close kin, and is, in fact, a misnomer. It represents the ultimate genetic selfishness. It is but the blind expression of inclusive fitness maximization.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en53" id="text00015.html#ch09en53">53</a></sup>This is not to say, however, that there is no altruism absent the close genetic relationship referred to by Hamilton and Van Den Berghe. The uncertainties introduced by the fact that humans reproduce sexually rather than through asexual cloning all but guarantee that an inclination to “inclusive fitness maximization” would stimulate a good deal of “altruism” rebounding to the benefit of alleles other than the “selfish gene.” In the first instance, there is always the possibility that some persons who undertake helping actions may do so in the mistaken assumption that they are helping close kin. The father who undertakes a sacrificial action for his offspring may not, in fact, be the progenitor but may merely think he is.<sup><a href="#text00015.html#ch09fn4" id="text00015.html#ch09-fn4">IV</a></sup>This is not merely a theme for soap operas; it is illustrative of a primordial puzzle— that survival of the “selfish genes” is probably facilitated if each apparent father behaves “as if” he actually is the father, despite the possibility that he is not.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>根据 Van Den, Berghe 的说法，『那么，利他主义主要针对的是亲属，尤其是近亲，事实上，它是一个错误的名称。它代表了最终的遗传自私。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en53" id="text00015.html#ch09en53">53</a></sup>然而，这并不是说没有汉密尔顿和范登伯格提到的密切遗传关系就没有利他主义。人类通过有性繁殖而不是无性克隆的事实所带来的不确定性，几乎保证了『包容性适应最大化』的倾向会刺激大量的『利他主义』反弹，使『自私基因』以外的等位基因受益。首先，总是存在这样一种可能性，即一些采取帮助行动的人可能会错误地认为他们在帮助近亲。为后代采取牺牲行动的父亲事实上可能不是祖先，而只是认为自己是。<sup><a href="#text00015.html#ch09fn4" id="text00015.html#ch09-fn4">四</a></sup>这不仅仅是一个肥皂剧的主题；它说明了一个原始的难题
                —— 如果每个表面上的父亲表现得『好像』他实际上是父亲，尽管他有可能不是父亲，那么『自私的基因』的生存可能会得到促进。</p>

            <!-- <p>Seen in their proper light, however, as Hirshleifer points out, many of the paradoxes of “altruism” are semantic muddles that frequently confuse or mislead people into losing sight of the context of competition in which “helping” could convey a survival advantage: “ ‘If an altruism choice of strategy is to be <em>viable</em>in competition with non-altruism, altruism must contribute to self-survival more than non-altruism does, and therefore it can’t really be altruism.’ All such muddles could be avoided if we drop the term ‘altruism’ and ask instead: What are the determinants of the entirely objective phenomenon that can be called <em>helping?”</em><sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en54" id="text00015.html#ch09en54">54</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，正如 Hirshleifer 所指出的，许多『利他主义』的悖论都是语义上的混淆，它们经常混淆或误导人们忽略了竞争的背景，在这种背景下，帮助可以传达一种生存优势：如果利他主义的策略选择在与非利他主义的竞争中是<strong>可行的</strong>，利他主义必须比非利他主义更有助于自我生存，因此它不可能真正是利他主义。如果我们放弃『利他主义』这个词，转而问道，『帮助的完全客观现象的决定因素是什么？』那么，所有这样的糊涂事就可以避免了。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en54" id="text00015.html#ch09en54">54</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>This question is perhaps most interesting in the case of “kinship helping.” Hamilton’s basic formulation of inclusive fitness involved a biological cost-benefit analysis in which an individual, or “the gene controlling helping behaviour,” values the survival of an identical copy of itself equally to its own survival. Therefore, the willingness to undertake helping, let alone sacrifice, varies with the chance that another individual has an identical gene. “Specifically, a gene for kinship helping instructs a man (other things equal) to give his life if he can thereby save two siblings, four half-siblings, eight cousins, etc.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en55" id="text00015.html#ch09en55">55</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这个问题在『亲属帮助』的情况下也许最有趣。 汉密尔顿对包容性适应的基本表述涉及一种生物成本效益分析，在这种分析中，一个个体或『控制帮助行为的基因』对自身的一个相同拷贝的生存的重视程度与自身的生存相同。因此，进行帮助的意愿，更不用说牺牲了，随着另一个个体拥有相同基因的机会而变化。具体来说，亲属帮助的基因指示一个人（其他条件相同），如果他能因此拯救两个兄弟姐妹、四个同父异母的兄弟姐妹、八个堂兄弟姐妹等，就会献出自己的生命。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en55" id="text00015.html#ch09en55">55</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <h2>PROBABILITY PROBLEMS OF INCLUSIVE FITNESS</h2><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h2>兼容并蓄的可能性问题</h2>

            <!-- <p>While this biologic seems clear in principle, upon closer examination it disguises a number of difficulties. For example, the fact that one’s siblings or children may have a 50 percent probability of sharing an identical gene does not, in strict logic, mean that it is actually expressed in them. Every individual carries two sets of each gene, one from, the father and one from the mother. But this, of course, means that only half of the genes carried by an individual parent are necessarily present in offspring. Furthermore, there is always the risk of mutation in reproduction, which, unlikely though it may be, reduces the certainty of genetic cost-benefit analysis. So if the metaphor of “gene as optimizer” is taken seriously, the case of the pater who is not the progenitor is only the most clear-cut example of a broader problem. If it is indeed the survival of the “selfish gene” that is optimized by sacrificing for near-relatives, then any possibility that results in the substitution of another allele for the identical copy of the “selfish gene” may be considered one of those intricate tricks that Mother Nature plays on herself.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>虽然这个生物原理看起来很清楚，但仔细研究后，它掩盖了一些困难。例如，一个人的兄弟姐妹或子女可能有 50% 的概率共享一个相同的基因，但从严格的逻辑来看，这并不意味着该基因在他们身上实际表达。每个人都携带两套基因，一套来自父亲，另一套来自母亲。但是，这当然意味着，父母双方携带的基因中只有一半必然存在于后代。此外，生殖过程中总是存在突变的风险，尽管这不太可能，但却降低了遗传成本效益分析的确定性。因此，如果『基因作为优化者』的隐喻被认真对待，那么不是祖先的父亲的情况只是一个更广泛问题的最明显的例子。如果确实是通过为近亲牺牲来优化『自私基因』的生存，那么任何导致另一个等位基因替代『自私基因』的相同拷贝的可能性都可以被视为大自然母亲对自己玩的那些复杂的把戏之一。</p>

            <!-- <h3>Uncertain Consequences</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
            <h3>不确定的后果</h3>

            <!-- <p>Altruism directed toward kin therefore involves problems. Not only is there the probability problem for the “selfish gene” that apparent relatives of its host may not, in fact, share its identical copies. There is also the difficulty of determining under conditions of uncertainty whether any given gesture of sacrifice will, in fact, primarily benefit relatives rather than others. (Sacrifice that primarily benefits others may actually harm the inclusive fitness of the selfish gene by reducing the prospects that it will be represented in succeeding populations.) Consider an awful example inspired by the news while we were writing. Suppose a parent in Dunblane, Scotland, learned on short notice that an armed lunatic was heading into a local school with the apparent intention of doing harm. By acting instantly, he or she could undertake the heroic but possibly doomed gesture of confronting the lunatic, and thereby possibly save his or her children at the school.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，针对亲属的利他主义涉及一些问题。对于『自私的基因』来说，不仅存在概率问题，即其宿主的明显亲属事实上可能不会分享其相同的副本。还有一个困难是，在不确定的条件下确定任何特定的牺牲姿态事实上是否主要有利于亲属而不是其他人。(主要有利于他人的牺牲实际上可能会损害自私基因的包容性，因为它减少了在后续种群中出现的可能性）。) 考虑一个可怕的例子，这个例子是在我们写作时受到新闻的启发。假设苏格兰邓布兰的一位家长在短时间内得知，一个武装的疯子正在进入当地的学校，显然是要进行伤害。通过即时行动，他或她可以采取英勇但可能注定失败的姿态，与该疯子对峙，从而可能拯救他或她在学校的孩子。</p>

            <!-- <p>Or possibly not.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>…… 或者可能不会。</p>

            <!-- <p>Even a ruthless lunatic intent on killing every child on the planet would be limited in the harm he could do before running short of ammunition or being subdued by others. Had the sacrificing parent decided not to intervene, more likely than not his children would have survived in any event, as most children at the school did. All the harm that a gallant act of sacrifice would have prevented probably would otherwise have fallen on the children of others. So by risking his or her life, primarily for the children of others, the father or mother in question might actually have reduced his “inclusive fitness.” By depriving all his children of one of their parents, he would probably have left those children in a worsened position in the Darwinian struggle.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>即使是一个打算杀死地球上所有儿童的冷酷无情的疯子，在弹药不足或被他人制服之前，他所能造成的伤害也是有限的。如果这位牺牲的父母决定不干预，那么他的孩子很可能在任何情况下都会活下来，就像学校里的大多数孩子一样。一个英勇的牺牲行为所避免的所有伤害可能会落到其他人的孩子身上。因此，通过冒着生命危险，主要是为了其他人的孩子，有关的父亲或母亲实际上可能已经降低了他的『包容性适应』。通过剥夺他的所有孩子的父母之一，他可能会让这些孩子在达尔文的斗争中处于更糟糕的地位。</p>

            <!-- <p>While this is admittedly a strained example, it is also realistic. It reflects the fact that there are countless circumstances in life in which large or small acts of helping have beneficial effects. In many cases, the direct beneficiaries of such actions cannot be easily isolated to closely related kin. And ironically, as we consider below, this may be part of the survival benefit that enabled those with less discriminate helping genes to endure all the millennia of unpleasantness until now.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管这确实是一个紧张的例子，但它也是现实的。它反映了这样一个事实：在生活中有无数的情况下，大大小小的帮助行为都会产生有益的影响。在许多情况下，这种行为的直接受益者不容易被隔离为密切相关的亲属。而具有讽刺意味的是，正如我们在下文中所考虑的那样，这可能是使那些具有较少歧视性的帮助基因的人能够忍受所有千年来的不愉快的部分生存利益。</p>

            <h3>利他主义和遗传惯性</h3>

            <!-- <p>If, as we believe, the “selfish gene” thesis is an accurate approximation of what motivates human action, it would be too simple to suppose that the helping or sacrificial behavior it engenders could operate narrowly and solely for the benefit of actual relatives. Imperfect knowledge makes distinguishing kin an uncertain art in some circumstances. And even assuming that kin were known, actual representation of any given “selfish gene” in the population of kin could not be ascertained as more than a matter of probabilities. Until recently, it would have been impossible to distinguish actual genetic markers among individuals. And we are still some distance from being able to practically distinguish which near-relatives actually express whatever “selfish gene” is optimizing its survival. Beyond that is the greater difficulty of confining benefits to kin rather than others.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>如果像我们所相信的那样，『自私的基因』论是对人类行动动机的准确近似，那么假设它所产生的帮助或牺牲行为可以狭义地运作，并且只为实际亲属的利益，那就太简单了。不完全的知识使区分亲属在某些情况下成为一种不确定的艺术。即使假设亲属是已知的，任何特定的『自私的基因』在亲属群体中的实际代表性也无法确定，而只是一个概率问题。直到最近，还不可能在个人之间区分出实际的遗传标记。而且我们离能够实际区分哪些近亲实际表达了什么『自私的基因』以优化其生存仍有一定距离。除此之外，将利益限制在亲属而不是其他人身上的困难更大。</p>

            <!-- <p>Furthermore, it is also obvious from experience that humans sometimes divert their “nurturing instincts” for the benefit of nonkin if appropriate kin are unavailable. The most clear-cut example of this is the behavior of parents toward adopted children, or even the behavior of certain persons, usually childless, toward their household pets. It is not unheard of for such individuals to court serious injury and even death to rescue cats trapped in a tree. Certainly, in any given year, a not-insignificant number of persons perish in household accidents precipitated in some fashion by pets who find their way into jeopardy. What is true of pets is more true of adoptive children. It is certainly not a stretch to say that parents of adopted children often treat them “as if” they were kin, thus giving the concept of “kin selection” another meaning.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>此外，从经验中也可以看出，如果没有合适的亲属，人类有时会为了非亲属的利益而转移他们的『养育本能』。这方面最明显的例子是父母对收养的孩子的行为，甚至是某些人（通常没有孩子）对其家庭宠物的行为。这些人为了营救被困在树上的猫，不惜造成严重的伤害，甚至死亡，这并非闻所未闻的事情。当然，在任何一年里，都有数量不小的人在家庭事故中丧生，而这些事故是由发现自己处于危险中的宠物以某种方式促成的。对宠物如此，对收养的孩子更是如此。可以说，被收养儿童的父母经常把他们』当作『亲属』来对待，从而使『亲属选择』的概念有了另一种含义。</p>

            <!-- <p>Such cases do not discredit the “selfish gene” theory as much as some critics would wish. To the contrary. We see examples of people behaving “as if” they were sacrificing for close relatives to advance their own inclusive fitness, as instances of “genetic inertia.” In other words, they reflect the fact, noted by Howard Margolis in <em>Selfishness, Altruism and Rationality,</em>that “human society changed faster” than human genetic makeup.

            <!-- <p>In short, for all of human existence prior to the advent of agriculture, ethnic groups were “inbreeding superfamilies.” Given this past identity between the family and the in-group, there could well be a genetically influenced tendency to treat the in-group as kin.

As Margolis suggests, it is easy to imagine that for “such small bands of hunter-gatherers, closely related, that inclusive selfishness (aside from any prospect of reciprocity or vengeance) would alone support a measure of commitment to group-interest.

            <p>考虑到各地的政治家都有一种强烈的倾向，即用借用亲属关系的术语来描述国家。国家是『我们的祖国』或『我们的祖国』。它的公民是『我们』，『家庭的成员』，我们的『兄弟姐妹』。 <sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en62" id="text00015.html#ch09en62">62</a></sup>像法国、中国和埃及这样文化不同的国家采用这样的比喻，在我们看来不是修辞上的巧合，而是『表观遗传』或受基因影响的动机因素天生偏向于人类的某些选择的主要例子。</p>

            <!-- <p>How does this epigenesis work? The identification mechanism employed to harness emotional loyalty to the nation-state makes use of various devices that would have been markers of kinship in the primitive past “to link the individual’s inclusive fitness concerns” with the interests of the state.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en63" id="text00015.html#ch09en63">63</a></sup>For example, Shaw and Wong focus on five identification devices used by modern nation-states to mobilize their populations against out-groups.

            <h3>遗传核算</h3>

            <!-- <p>The imaginary character of these kinship links as far as the state is concerned is evidenced by the fact that they possess none of the degrees of variability that characterize actual kinship. Even in extended families, where everyone is related, not everyone is related to the same degree. Parents and siblings are the closest relations, grandparents and cousins are less close, with distant, kissing cousins so remote that they are barely more likely than complete strangers to share any given gene in common. Husbands and wives generally are no longer closely related, as they tended to be in the Stone Age. In any event, all actual kinship is definable in mathematical terms as the “coefficient of relatedness,” which Hamilton calculated as a measure of genetic overlap.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en65" id="text00015.html#ch09en65">65</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>就国家而言，这些亲属关系的想象性特征表现在：它们不具备实际亲属关系所具有的任何变化程度。即使在大家族中，每个人都有关系，但不是每个人都有相同程度的关系。父母和兄弟姐妹是最亲近的关系，祖父母和堂兄弟姐妹则不那么亲近，遥远的、亲近的堂兄弟姐妹如此遥远，以至于他们几乎不可能比完全陌生的人分享任何特定的共同基因。丈夫和妻子一般不再像石器时代那样密切相关。在任何情况下，所有实际的亲属关系都可以用数学术语定义为『亲缘关系系数』，汉密尔顿将其计算为基因重叠的措施。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en65" id="text00015.html#ch09en65">65</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>By contrast, the national “family” is imagined to be totally and elastically coincident with the state’s territorial dimensions. Nationality extends uniformly, like a liquid, into every crevice within the strictly defined boundaries. Benedict Anderson writes, “In the modern conception, state sovereignty is fully, flatly and evenly operative over each square centimeter of a legally demarcated territory.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en66" id="text00015.html#ch09en66">66</a></sup>And, of course, when it comes to sacrifice for the state, the coefficient of imaginary relatedness is always one.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>相比之下，民族『家庭』被想象为与国家的领土国家范围完全和弹性地吻合。国籍像液体一样均匀地延伸到严格定义的边界内的每个缝隙。本尼迪克特·安德森（<em>Benedict Anderson</em>）写道：『在现代概念中，国家主权在法律划定的领土国家的每一平方厘米上都是完全的、平坦的、均匀的运作。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en66" id="text00015.html#ch09en66">66</a></sup>全国性的亲缘关系系数为

            <!-- <p>This identification of inclusive fitness with the nation-state is interesting because it could help inform the disposition of humans to welcome or resist the changes of the new millennium. As we have explored earlier, prior to the Information Age all types of society were territorially based. They either formed around the home territory of the nucleus ethnic group, or, as with the nation-state, played upon the same motives of group solidarity to mobilize force for defense of a local territory against outsiders. In every case, it was the stranger outside of one’s immediate territory who was feared as the enemy. Given the assumptions of kin selection in the primordial past, this made sense. When humanity emerged in its current genetic form, members of the tribe were close kin. They were members of a nucleus ethnic group, “the inbreeding superfamily.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种将包容性适应与领土国家相提并论的做法很有意思，因为它有助于为人类欢迎或抵制新千年的变化提供信息。正如我们前面所探讨的，在信息时代之前，所有类型的社会都是以领土国家为基础的。它们或者围绕着核心族群的家乡领土国家形成，或者像领土国家一样，利用群体团结的相同动机，动员力量保卫当地领土国家，对抗外来者。在每一种情况下，一个人的直接领地之外的陌生人都被视为敌人而感到恐惧。鉴于原始时代的亲属选择的假设，这是有道理的。当人类以其目前的遗传形式出现时，部落的成员是近亲。他们是一个核心种族群体的成员，即『近亲繁殖的超级家族』。</p>

            <!-- <p>Furthermore, there really was a practical economic reason, given the imperatives of kin selection, for the individual to identify the prosperity and survival of immediate kin with that of his tribe, or superfamily. A member of a hunter-gatherer tribe really did depend for his prosperity upon the success of the whole tribe. There was no independent property, nor any way that an individual or family could plausibly have hoped to survive and prosper if detached from the tribe. This strongly linked the individual’s self-interest to that of the group. In Hirshleifer’s words, “To the extent that members of a group share a common fate or outcome, helping one another becomes self-help.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en67" id="text00015.html#ch09en67">67</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>此外，考虑到亲属选择的必要性，个人将直系亲属的繁荣和生存与他的部落或超级家庭的繁荣和生存联系起来，确实有一个实际的经济理由。狩猎·采集部落的一个成员的繁荣确实取决于整个部落的成功。没有独立的财产，也没有任何方式可以让个人或家庭在脱离部落的情况下有希望生存和繁荣。这使个人的自我利益与群体的利益紧密相连。用 Hirshleifer 的话说，『在一个群体的成员分享共同命运或结果的情况下，互相帮助就成了自助。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en67" id="text00015.html#ch09en67">67</a></sup></p>

Information technology is creating economic inequality magnitudes outside the range of anything experienced by our ancestors in the pristinely egalitarian Stone Age. Information technology is also creating supraterritorial assets, which will help to subvert the embodiment of the in-group, the nation-state. Ironically, these new cyberassets will probably be of higher value precisely because they are established at a distance from home. All the more so if there is an invidious backlash of the kind we expect against the economic inequality arising from increasing penetration of information technology in the rich industrial countries. That very fact would tend to make assets held at long distance more valuable. They would not only be less exposed to envy, they would be more likely to be put beyond the reach of the most predatory group with which an individual must cope—his own nation-state.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>It is perhaps a mark of the importance of epigenesis in informing attitudes that so little notice has been taken of the ironies of in-group identification as it relates to the modern nation-state. The logic of violence in the modern period tended to confound the very impulse that gave rise to the tendency to identify fitness with the in-group in the first place. Why? Because rather than facilitating the survival and prosperity of near-relatives in a hostile world, the identification of the individual’s “inclusive fitness” with a national in-group diluted the value of any act of sacrifice the individual might have made to the level of insignificance for his kin. The typical modern nation-state was simply too large to allow for a statistically significant “coefficient of relatedness” between the individual and other citizens of the nation that laid claim to him. Not only was the proportion of close relatives within the in-group sharply diminished from almost unity in the Stone Age to a bare chemical trace in the twentieth century; the “coefficient of relatedness” between the individual citizen and the rest of the nation would not, in most cases, have been significantly higher than with the whole human race. An “in-group” with tens of millions or even hundreds of millions (or in the case of the Chinese, more than a billion members) became so gigantic as to dilute the inclusive fitness effect of any sacrifice or benefit conveyed to the scale of a spit in the ocean. In strict logic, therefore, the modern nationalist, unlike the hunter-gatherer of the Stone Age, could not reasonably expect any gesture of sacrifice or helping for his “in-group” to enhance the survival prospects for his family in a meaningful way.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这也许是表观遗传学对态度的重要性的一个标志，因为人们很少注意到与现代领土国家有关的群体内认同的讽刺。现代时期的暴力逻辑倾向于混淆这种冲动，这种冲动首先引起了对内群体认同的倾向。为什么？因为在一个敌对的世界里，对个人的『包容性适应』与国家内部群体的认同，非但没有促进近亲的生存和繁荣，反而将个人可能做出的任何牺牲的价值稀释到对其亲属无足轻重的程度。典型的现代领土国家实在是太大了，以至于个人和对他提出要求的国家的其他公民之间的『亲属关系系数』在统计学上是很重要的。不仅近亲在同族中的比例从石器时代的几乎统一急剧减少到二十世纪几乎没有化学痕迹；在大多数情况下，公民个人与国家其他成员之间的『关系系数』不会比整个人类高得多。一个拥有数千万甚至数亿（或者在中国人的情况下，超过十亿）成员的『内群体』变得如此巨大，以至于将任何牺牲或利益的包容性适应效果稀释到海洋中的一个吐口的规模。因此，在严格的逻辑下，现代民族主义者与石器时代的狩猎采集者不同，不能合理地期望任何为其『内部群体』做出的牺牲或帮助的姿态能有意义地提高其家庭的生存前景。</p>

            <!-- <p>Notwithstanding the fact that national economies became the fundamental units of account in which well-being was measured in the modem era, the largest obstacle to the talented individual’s success, and therefore to that of his kin, became the burdens imposed in the name of the nation, the in-group itself. This, at least, was true for those primarily engaged in reciprocal rather than coercive sociality—to revisit Van Den Berghe’s categories of human behavior.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en68" id="text00015.html#ch09en68">68</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管国家经济成为现代衡量福祉的基本核算单位，但对有才能的个人的成功，以及对其亲属的成功而言，最大的障碍是以国家的名义强加的负担，也就是内群体本身。至少，对于那些主要从事互惠性而非强制性社会活动的人来说是如此 —— 重新审视范登贝格的人类行为类别。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en68" id="text00015.html#ch09en68">68</a></sup></p>


            <!-- <p>The logic of the nation-state suggests that the ultimate price of citizenship is sacrifice and death. As Jane Bethke Elshtain observed, nation-states indoctrinate citizens more for sacrifice than aggression: “The young man goes to war not so much to kill as to die, to forfeit his particular body for that of the large body, the body politic.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en69" id="text00015.html#ch09en69">69</a></sup>The impulse to sacrifice is no less active where the taxpayer is concerned. Paying taxes, like bearing arms, is a duty, rather than an exchange in which one forgoes money to obtain some product or service of an equal or greater value. This much is acknowledged in common speech. People speak of a “tax burden” as they do not speak of the “food burden” of shopping for nutriments, or the “car burden” of purchasing an automobile, or a “vacation burden” for traveling, precisely because commercial purchases are generally fair exchanges. Otherwise, the buyers would not make them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>领土国家的逻辑表明，公民身份的最终代价是牺牲和死亡。正如简·贝特克·埃尔斯坦所观察到的，领土国家向公民灌输的是牺牲而不是侵略。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en69" id="text00015.html#ch09en69">69</a></sup>对于纳税人来说，牺牲的冲动也同样活跃。纳税，就像携带武器一样，是一种责任，而不是一种交换，在这种交换中，人们放弃金钱来获得一些具有同等或更大价值的产品或服务。这一点在普通的讲话中得到了承认。人们不谈论『税收负担』，就像他们不谈论购买营养品的『食品负担』，或购买汽车的『汽车负担』，或旅行的『度假负担』一样，正是因为商业购买通常是公平的交换。否则，购买者就不会这样做。</p>

            <!-- <p>In this respect, nationalism shows how epigenesis can reverse the logic of the Darwinian “economy of nature.” The nation-state facilitated systematic, territorially based predation. Unlike the situation faced by hunter-gatherers in the Stone Age, the main parasite and predator upon the individual at the end of the twentieth century was not likely to be the “outsider,” the foreign enemy, but rather the presumed embodiment of the “in-group,” the local nation-state itself. Thus the main advantage offered by the advent of assets that transcend territoriality in the Information Age is precisely the fact that such assets can be placed beyond the reach of the systematic coercion mobilized by the local nation-state in whose territory the would-be Sovereign Individual was resident.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在这方面，民族主义显示了外源性如何扭转达尔文『自然经济』的逻辑。领土国家促进了系统的、基于领土国家的掠夺。与石器时代的狩猎采集者所面临的情况不同，在二十世纪末，个人的主要寄生虫和捕食者不可能是『外来者』，即外国的敌人，而是『内群体』的假定化身，即当地领土国家本身。因此，在信息时代，超越领土国家的资产的出现所提供的主要优势，正是这种资产可以被置于当地领土国家所动员的系统性胁迫的范围之外，而未来的主权个体就居住在这个领土国家上。</p>

They will be extranational sovereigns over themselves, not subjects, in the new “Virtual City,” owing allegiance by contract or private treaty in a fashion more reminiscent of premodern Europe, where merchants secured commercial treaties and charters to protect themselves “from arbitrary seizures of property” and to obtain “exemption from seigneurial law.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en70" id="text00015.html#ch09en70">70</a></sup>In the cyberculture, successful persons will gain exemption from duties of citizenship arising from an accident of birth.

They do not propose that those among the information elite whose attitudes they despise have miscalculated where their best interests lie.

As new, more market-driven forms of protection become available, it will become increasingly evident to the large numbers of able persons that most of the supposed benefits of nationality are imaginary. This will lead not only to better accounting of the opportunity costs of citizenship, it will also create new ways of framing allegedly “political” and even “economic” questions. For the first time, “an individual entrepreneur acting for and by himself” will be able to vary his own protection costs by moving between jurisdictions, without waiting for them to be effected by “group decision and group action,” to quote Frederic C.

Over time, it will become ever more obvious that survival of the nation-state and the nationalist sensibility are preconditions for preserving a realm for political compulsion.

Environmentalists, for example, will focus less on protecting “Mother Earth” and more on protecting the “motherland.” For reasons we explore later, the nation and citizenship will be especially sacred to those who value equality highly. More than they may now understand, they will come to agree with Christopher Lasch, who followed Hannah Arendt in proclaiming, “It is citizenship that confers equality, not equality that creates a right to citizenship.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en82" id="text00015.html#ch09en82">82</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>大多数怀有热忱的政治议程的人，无论是民族主义者、环境主义者还是社会主义者，都会在二十一世纪到来之际团结起来捍卫摇摆不定的领土国家。随着时间的推移，领土国家和民族主义情感的生存将变得越来越明显，这是维护政治强制力领域的前提条件。正如 Billig 所指出的，民族主义『是常规（政治）战略的条件，不管是什么特定的政治。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en81" id="text00015.html#ch09en81">81</a></sup>因此，所有政治方案中的民族主义内容将在未来几年内像饕餮大餐一样膨胀起来。例如，环保主义者将减少对保护『地球母亲』的关注，而是更多地关注保护『祖国』。由于我们后面要探讨的原因，国家和公民身份对那些高度重视平等的人来说将是特别神圣的。比起他们现在可能理解的，他们会同意克里斯托弗·拉什的观点，他跟随汉娜·阿伦特宣称：『是公民权赋予了平等，而不是平等创造了公民权。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en82" id="text00015.html#ch09en82">82</a></sup></p>

Citizenship will no longer serve as a mechanism for enforcing income redistribution based upon the equality of the vote within a confined territory. The consequences will include another bruising for the progressive view of history. Contrary to the expectations of supposedly forward-thinking people when the twentieth century opened, the free market was not destroyed by the decades but left triumphant. The Marxists anticipated the eclipse of capitalism, which never happened, to lead to the transcendence of nation-states and the emergence of a universal class consciousness among workers. In fact, the state will be eclipsed, but in a very different way. Something more nearly the opposite to their expectation is happening. The triumph of capitalism will lead to the emergence of a new global, or extranational, consciousness among the capitalists, many of whom will become Sovereign Individuals. Far from depending upon the state to discipline the workers, as the Marxists imagined, the ablest, wealthiest persons were net losers from the actions of the nation-state. It is clearly they who have the most to gain by transcending nationalism as markets triumph over compulsion.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

As previously indicated, each $5,000 in tax paid annually reduces your lifetime net worth by $2.4 million if you can earn 10 percent annually from your investments. But if you could earn 20 percent, each $5,000 in annual tax payments would leave you $44 million poorer over a period of forty years. Cumulatively, paying $5,000 per year would therefore cost you more than a million dollars per year. At that rate, $250,000 per year in tax would soon translate to an annual loss of more than $50 million, or $2.2 billion in a lifetime. And, of course, sporadically higher earnings, for even a few years, especially early in life, imply a still more startling loss of wealth to predatory taxation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>目前由高税收资助的政府服务非但没有遭受损失或缩减，信息精英们还将以一种无与伦比的方式蓬勃发展。仅仅通过摆脱他们现在支付的超额税收负担，他们将获得巨大的利润来改善他们家庭的物质生活。如前所述，如果你能从你的投资中获得 10% 的收益，每年支付的每 5000 美元的税款会使你一生的净资产减少 240 万美元。但是，如果你能赚到 20%，每年支付的每 5,000 美元的税款将使你在 40 年内减少 4400 万美元。因此，累积起来，每年支付 5000 美元将使你每年损失超过 100
                万美元。按照这个比例，每年 25 万美元的税款很快就会转化为每年超过 5000 万美元的损失，或者一生中的 22 亿美元。当然，零星的高收入，哪怕只有几年，尤其是在生命的早期，也意味着掠夺性税收带来的财富损失更加惊人。</p>

While this is contrary to the logic of nationalism, it accords with a compelling economic logic. A 10 percent, let alone a tenfold, bottom-line difference will frequently motivate profit-maximizing individuals to alter their lifestyles and production techniques, as well as their place of abode. The history of Western civilization is a record of restless change in which people and prosperity have repeatedly migrated to new areas of opportunity under the spur of meandering megapolitical conditions. A thousandfold difference in bottom-line returns would match the most potent stimulus that has ever put rational people in motion. Or put another way, most people, particularly those Thomas L. Friedman calls the “losers and left-behinds,” if given a chance, would gladly leave any nation-state for $50 million, not to mention the still greater costs that nation-states impose in tax extracted from the top 1 percent of taxpayers. The rise of Sovereign Individuals shopping for jurisdictions is therefore one of the surest forecasts one can make.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            </ul>

            <!-- <p>This is all unremarkable except that it focuses attention upon the distinction between sovereignty and citizenship. As Ireland says, “Under traditional legal and political concepts, the monarch is sovereign and the people are his/ her subjects. Subjects are bound to the monarch by allegiance and subjection.” Noting the obvious fact that Queen Elizabeth II is sovereign, he concludes that “there is an argument that the Queen is not an Australian citizen.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en84" id="text00015.html#ch09en84">84</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>除了将注意力集中在主权和公民权的区别上，这些都是不值得注意的。正如爱尔兰所说，『根据传统的法律和政治概念，君主是主权者，人民是他/她的臣民。臣民通过效忠和服从对君主进行约束』。注意到女王伊丽莎白二世是主权者这一明显的事实，他得出结论：『据说女王不是澳大利亚公民。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en84" id="text00015.html#ch09en84">84</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Indeed, she is not. The Queen, long may she live, is fortunate to be beyond caring about being a citizen. She is sovereign, the Sovereign over her subjects. Like a handful of other monarchs in the world, the Queen is sovereign by birth, having inherited her status as a matter of custom that predates modern times. The idea of monarchy is ancient, going back to the earliest historic records of human life. Those countries that have retained their monarchy owe their constitution to their ancient history, but it still helps to decide the shape of their society, in terms of class prestige if not of political power. Postmodern individuals, without the Queen’s head start, will be obliged to invent new legal rationales upon which to base the <em>de facto</em>sovereignty that information technology will hand them.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>的确，她不是。女王，愿她长命百岁，很幸运地不必关心自己是否是一个公民。她是君主，是她的臣民的君主。像世界上其他少数几个君主一样，女王是天生的主权者，她的地位是在现代之前的习俗中继承下来的。君主制的概念是古老的，可以追溯到人类生活的最早历史记录。那些保留了君主制的国家将其宪法归功于其古老的历史，但它仍然有助于决定其社会的形态，即使不是政治权力，也是阶级威望的体现。后现代的个人，由于没有女王的先机，将不得不发明新的法律依据，作为信息技术将赋予他们的<strong>事实上的</strong>主权的基础。</p>

            <!-- <p>Sovereign Individuals will also have to cope with the corrosive consequences of envy—a difficulty that sometimes detains monarchs, but which will be more intensely felt by persons who are not traditionally venerated but invent their own sovereignty. As Helmut Schoeck wrote in his comprehensive survey, <em>Envy,</em>“Where there is only one king, one president of the United States—in other words, one member only of a particular status—he can live with relative impunity the kind of life which, even on a much smaller scale, would arouse indignation in the same society were it to be adopted by successful members of larger professional or social groups.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en85" id="text00015.html#ch09en85">85</a></sup>Monarchs, as embodiments of the nation, enjoy a certain immunity to envy that will not carry over to Sovereign Individuals.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>主权个体也将不得不应对嫉妒的腐蚀后果 —— 这种困难有时会让君主感到不安，但那些不受传统崇敬但却发明了自己的主权的人将会更强烈地感受到这一点。正如赫尔穆特·肖克（<em>Helmut Schoeck</em>）在他的综合调查报告《嫉妒》中写道：『在只有一个国王、一个美国总统的地方 —— 换句话说，只有一个特定身份的成员，他可以相对不受惩罚地过着那种即使在小得多的范围内，如果被较大的职业或社会团体的成功成员采用，也会在同一个社会中引起愤慨的生活。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en85" id="text00015.html#ch09en85">85</a></sup>君主作为国家的化身，享有某种对嫉妒的豁免权，这种豁免权不会延续到主权个体。</p>

But the creation of conceptual wealth, like artistic performance, varies dramatically among persons using the same tools. In this respect, the whole of the economy is becoming increasingly like opera, where the highest rewards go to those with the best voices, and those who sing out of tune, however earnestly, do not normally attract large rewards. As many fields are opened to truly global competition, the return for ordinary performance is bound to fall. Middle talents will be in vast supply, some originating with persons who can rent their time for a fraction of the rates that prevail in the leading industrial countries. The losers will be the minor-league outfielders with “slider speed bats” whose reflexes are half a second shy of hitting a major league fastball.

It is usually they who could not increase their wealth by moving to another jurisdiction. Much of their income is lodged in the rules of a national political jurisdiction rather than conveyed by market valuations. Therefore, eliminating or sharply reducing the taxes that are negatively compounding against their net worths may not appear to make them much better off—the price of lower taxation is a diminished stream of transfer payments. They will lose income because they will no longer be able to depend upon political compulsion to pick the pockets of persons more productive than themselves. Those without savings who rely upon government to pay their retirement benefits and medical care will in all probability suffer a fall in living standards. This loss of income translates into a depreciation of what financial writer Scott Burns has dubbed “transcendental” or political capital.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en88" id="text00015.html#ch09en88">88</a></sup>This “transcendental” or imaginary capital is based not upon the economic ownership of assets but upon the <em>de facto</em>claim to the income stream established by political rules and regulations.

            <!-- <p>Equally, every time a nation-state cracks up, it will facilitate further devolution and encourage the autonomy of Sovereign Individuals. We expect to see a significant multiplication of sovereign entities, as scores of enclaves and jurisdictions more akin to city-states emerge from the rubble of nations. These new entities will include many that will offer highly competitive pricing of protection services, imposing low taxes or none at all on income and capital. The new entities are almost bound to price their protection services more attractively than do the leading OECD nation-states. Seen simply as a matter of market segmentation, the area of the market that is most poorly served is the high-efficiency, low-cost end. Anyone who wishes to pay high taxes in exchange for a complicated array of state spending has ample opportunity to do so. Therefore, the most advantageous and profitable strategy for a new minisovereignty is almost bound to lie with a high-efficiency, low-price alternative. Such a minisovereignty could only with great difficulty expect to provide a more complete array of services than those on offer from the surviving nation-states. Since all nation-states will certainly not collapse at once, the statist alternative is likely to be well supplied, especially early in the transition. On the other hand, a no-frills regime of tolerable law and order can be provided relatively cheaply. If social unrest and crime spread in the old core industrial countries to the degree that we expect, tolerable law and order will be far more appealing in a jurisdiction than a national space program, a state-sponsored women’s museum, or subsidized retraining schemes for displaced executives.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

This will make it practical for individuals to cease to identify themselves in national terms. Yet the demystification of citizenship will be a slow process. You are constantly exposed to a barrage of banal messages in the routines of daily life designed to reinforce your identification with your local nation-state. These messages make it highly unlikely for you to forget “your nationality.” For many people, nationality is a crucial badge of identity. “We” are taught to see the world in terms of nationality. It is “our” country, “our” athletes compete in the Olympics. When they win, it is “our” flag that waves in the ceremony. “Our” anthem brings the judges and other competitors to attention in the awards ceremony. “We” are led to believe that it is “our” victory, although it is never quite clear how “we” participated, other than by being within the same territory as a citizen.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>As information technology comes to the fore, it will help facilitate the global perspective already evident in the attitudes of MTV viewers, as well as create ways by which Sovereign Individuals can harness the latent possibilities of information technology to escape from the nationalist burden of taxation. Within the next few decades, for example, narrow-casting will replace <em>broad</em>casting as the method by which individuals obtain their news. This has significant implications. It amounts to a change in the imaginations of millions from first personal plural to singular. As individuals themselves begin to serve as their own news editors, selecting what topics and news stories are of interest, it is far less likely that they will choose to indoctrinate themselves in the urgencies of sacrifice for the nation-state. Indeed, their attitudes are more likely to be informed by the global culture to which they relate as consumers, of entertainment than by the highly personal “news” narrow-casts to which they may subscribe. Much the same effect will arise from the privatization of education, again facilitated by technology. In the medieval period, education was firmly under the control of the Church. In the modern age, education has been under the control of the state. In the words of Eric Hobsbawm, “state education transformed people into citizens of a specific country: ‘peasants into Frenchmen.’ <em>”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en90" id="text00015.html#ch09en90">90</a></sup></em>In the Information Age, education will be privatized and individualized.

Nationalism will not be constantly massaged into every corner of the mind’s life.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>随着信息技术的发展，它将有助于促进在 MTV 观众的态度中已经很明显的全球视角，并创造出一些方法，使主权个体能够利用信息技术的潜在可能性来摆脱税收的民族主义负担。例如，在未来几十年内，狭义广播将取代广义广播，成为个人获取新闻的方法。这具有重大意义。它相当于将数百万人的想象力从第一人称复数变为单数。当个人自己开始充当自己的新闻编辑，选择感兴趣的话题和新闻故事时，他们选择向自己灌输为领土国家牺牲的紧迫性和可能性就会大大降低。事实上，他们的态度更有可能受到全球文化的影响，他们作为消费者与娱乐有关，而不是受到他们可能订阅的高度个人化的『新闻』窄播的影响。教育的私有化也会产生同样的效果，这也是由技术促成的。在中世纪，教育被牢牢置于教会的控制之下。在现代社会，教育一直在国家的控制之下。用埃里克·霍布斯鲍姆的话说，『国家教育将人们转变为特定国家的公民：「农民变成法国人」』。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en90" id="text00015.html#ch09en90">90</a></sup>在信息时代，教育将被私有化和个人化。它将不再像工业时期的教育那样被沉重的政治包袱所束缚。民族主义将不再被不断灌输到思想生活的每个角落。</p>

            <!-- <p>For the first time since the medieval period of fragmented sovereignty, borders will not be clearly demarcated. As we explored earlier, there will be no distinct territory in which many future financial transactions will occur. Instead of accepting an inheritance of liabilities on the basis of an accident of birth, increasing numbers of Sovereign Individuals will take advantage of this ambiguity to desert their tax liabilities, moving beyond citizenship to become customers. They will negotiate private tax treaties as customers, along the lines now available in Switzerland, as analyzed in Chapter 8. A typical private tax treaty negotiated with the French-speaking Swiss cantons allows an individual or family to reside in exchange for a fixed annual tax payment of 50,000 Swiss francs (currently about $45,000). Note that this is not a flat-<em>rate</em>tax, but a flat amount of tax fixed without respect to income. If your annual income is 50,000 Swiss francs ($45,000), you should not enter into such a private tax treaty because your tax rate would be 100 percent. At an income of 500,000 Swiss francs, your rate is 10 percent. At SF5,000,000, the rate is just 1 percent. At SF50 million, your tax rate is just 1/10th of 1 percent. If this seems an incredibly good deal compared to a marginal rate of 58 percent in New York City, that is merely a measure of how predatory and monopolistic the pricing of government services generally became during the industrial period.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>自中世纪主权分散的时期以来，边界将首次没有明确的划分。正如我们之前所探讨的，未来的许多金融交易将没有明确的领土国家。越来越多的『主权个体』将利用这种模糊性来逃避他们的税收责任，而不是接受基于出生时的责任继承，超越公民身份而成为客户。正如第八章所分析的那样，他们将作为客户与瑞士谈判私人税收协定。一个典型的与瑞士自由港各州谈判的私人税收协定允许个人或家庭居住，以换取每年 50,000 瑞士法郎（目前约 45,000 美元）的固定税款。请注意，这不是一个『统一的税率税』，而是一个不考虑收入的固定税额。如果你的年收入是
                50,000 瑞士法郎（45,000 美元），你不应该签订这样的私人税收协定，因为你的税率将是 100%。在收入为 50 万瑞士法郎时，你的税率为 10%。在 500 万瑞郎时，税率仅为 1%。在 5000 万瑞士法郎时，你的税率只是 1% 的 1/10。如果与纽约市 58% 的边际税率相比，这似乎是一个令人难以置信的好交易，这只是衡量工业时期政府服务的定价普遍变得多么具有掠夺性和垄断性。</p>

            <!-- <p>In fact, 50,000 Swiss francs is an ample annual payment for the necessary and useful services of government. The Swiss surely make a large profit from serving every millionaire who moves in and pays them 50,000 Swiss francs annually for the privilege. In many cases, the government’s marginal cost to have another millionaire living in the jurisdiction is approximately zero. Therefore, its annual profit on the transaction will approach 50,000 Swiss francs. Any service that can be undercut and still allow the low-cost provider approximately a 100 percent profit is monopolized and overpriced to an extreme. What is remarkable is not that the rate of tax charged should fall as a percentage of income in this particular case, but that it should ever have seemed “fair” that different persons should pay wildly different amounts for the services of government during the twentieth century. This is particularly odd in that those who use government services the most pay the least, and those who use them least pay the most. All of them will provide an advantage as a domicile over the United States worth tens of millions over a lifetime to any high-income American. Unless U.S. taxes are reformed to become more competitive with those of other jurisdictions, and are no longer levied on the basis of nationality, thinking persons will renounce U.S. citizenship, notwithstanding the obstacles imposed by Clinton’s exit tax, to take up passports that entail less onerous liabilities.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>事实上，50,000 瑞士法郎对于政府提供的必要和有用的服务来说，是一笔充足的年度支付。瑞士人肯定会从为每一个迁入的百万富翁提供服务并每年向他们支付 5 万瑞士法郎的特权中获得巨大的利润。在许多情况下，政府让另一个百万富翁居住在辖区内的边际成本大约是零。因此，政府在这项交易中的年利润将接近 5 万瑞士法郎。任何可以被压低价格并仍能让低成本提供者获得大约 100% 的利润的服务都是垄断的，价格过高到了极点。难能可贵的是，在这种特殊情况下，征收的税率在收入中的比例应该下降，但在二十世纪，不同的人为政府的服务支付的金额大不相同，这似乎才是『公平』。这一点特别奇怪，因为那些使用政府服务最多的人支付最少的费用，而那些使用政府服务最少的人支付最多的费用。所有这些人都会作为美国的一个住所，对任何高收入的美国人来说，在一生中价值数千万的优势。除非美国的税收进行改革，使其与其他司法管辖区的税收相比更具竞争力，并且不再以国籍为基础进行征收，否则有思想的人将放弃美国公民身份，尽管克林顿的出境税给他们带来了障碍，但他们会拿起那些带来较少责任的护照。</p>

They abandoned chivalry. Sworn oaths and personal fealty ceased to be taken as seriously as they had been for the previous five centuries.

Early in the twenty-first century, large aging populations in Europe and North America will find themselves with insufficient savings to meet medical expenses and finance their lifestyles in retirement. For example, fully 65 percent of Americans have no savings for retirement at all. None. And those who do save save far too little. The average American will reach sixty-five facing expected medical bills of more than $200,000 before death and with a net worth of less than $75,000. Even the minority with private pensions are unlikely to be comfortable. The average pension will replace only 20 percent of preretirement income. Most of the assets of the typical retiree are not real wealth but “transcendental capital,” the expected value of transfer payments. Most people have been conditioned to rely upon these transfer payments to make up the gap in their private resources. The catch is that they are unlikely to be forthcoming. Pay-as-you-go systems will lack the cash flow or resources to make good on them. A study conducted by Neil Howe showed that even if pretax incomes in the United States were to rise faster than they have over the past twenty years, average after-tax incomes in America would have to be pushed down by 59 percent by 2040 in order to finance Social Security and government medical programs at current levels.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <h2>从暴力角度看问题</h2>

            <!-- <p>There are at least two contending theories about what precipitates violence in conditions of change. Historian Charles Tilly summarizes one theory: “The stimulus to collective violence comes largely from the anxieties people experience when established institutions fall apart. If misery or danger compounds the anxiety, runs the theory, the reaction becomes all the more violent.” In Tilly’s view, however, violence is not so much a product of “anxiety” as it is a far more rational attempt to bully authorities into “meeting their responsibilities” motivated by a “sense of justice denied.” According to Tilly’s interpretation, “large structural changes” tend to stimulate collective violence of a “political” nature. “Instead of constituting a sharp break from ‘normal’ political life, furthermore, violent struggles tend to accompany, complement, and extend organized, peaceful attempts by the same people to accomplish their objectives. They belong to the same world as nonviolent contention.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en94" id="text00015.html#ch09en94">94</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>关于在变化的条件下是什么催生了暴力，至少有两种争论的理论。历史学家查尔斯·蒂利（<em>Charles Tilly</em>）总结了一种理论：『对集体暴力的刺激主要来自于人们在既定体制瓦解时的焦虑。如果苦难或危险加剧了焦虑，理论上讲，反应就会变得更加暴力。』 然而，在蒂利看来，暴力与其说是『焦虑』的产物，不如说是在『正义被剥夺的感觉』的驱使下，试图欺负当局『履行他们的责任』的一种更为理性的尝试。根据蒂利的解释，『大型结构性变化』往往会刺激具有『政治性质的集体暴力。』此外，暴力斗争并不构成对『正常』政治生活的急剧中断，而是倾向于伴随、补充和扩展同一批人为实现其目标而进行的有组织的和平尝试。它们与非暴力抗争属于同一个世界。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en94" id="text00015.html#ch09en94">94</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Whichever theory of violence is more correct, prospects for social peace during the Great Transformation would appear to be limited. The collapse of the nation-state surely counts as a conspicuous example of an “established institution falling apart.” Therefore, anxieties are likely to be in full flower, as will the political inspiration for violence. This could be especially true in the leading welfare states, where populations are accustomed to relative income equality. Given that populations in the early stages of the information economy will have come of age during the industrial period, when political authorities did have the capacity to answer grievances with material benefits, it is reasonable to expect the “left-behinds” to continue to demand material benefits. It will probably take a slow, painful tutorial in the realities of the cybereconomy before OECD populations are weaned away from expectations of being able to compel income redistribution on a large scale.

As the larger, more inclusive national grouping begins to break down, with the more mobile “information elite” globalizing their affairs, the “losers and left-behinds” fall back upon membership in an ethnic subgroup, a tribe, a gang, a religious or linguistic minority.

In those parts of the world where dynamic, proselytizing religions are active, part of the popularity of their programs depends on the fact that they tend to hark back to premodern mechanisms for providing social welfare and public goods.

            <!-- <p>The argument is not dissimilar to the psychological explanation for the appeal of fascism developed by Erich Fromm in his famous work <em>Escape from Freedom,</em>first published in 1941.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en98" id="text00015.html#ch09en98">98</a></sup>According to Fromm, social mobility introduced by capitalism had destroyed the fixed identities of traditional village life. The son of a farmer no longer knew that he would inevitably be a farmer, or even that he would be bound to live scrabbling to harvest a crop on the same poor ground that his father tilled. He now had a broad choice of occupation. He could become a schoolteacher, a merchant, a soldier; study medicine or take to the sea. Even as a farmer, he could emigrate to the United States, Canada, or Argentina and make a life far from the home of his forebears. This freedom that capitalism provided to people “to create their own identities” proved scary to those who were not prepared to make creative use of it. As Billig said, they yearned “for the security of a solid identity,” and were “drawn towards the simplicities of nationalist and fascist propaganda,”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en99" id="text00015.html#ch09en99">99</a></sup>Equally as Billig writes of the twilight of the industrial era, “There is a global psychology, which strikes the nation from above, withering loyalties with a free play of identities.

We see the growth of victimization as mainly an attempt to buy social peace by not only widening membership in the meritocracy as Lasch argues, but also by reconstituting the rationalizations for income redistribution. The new sport of victimology emerged in its most exaggerated form in North America because information technology penetrated more deeply there. We suspect, however, that new myths of discrimination will be common, to one degree or another, in all industrial societies in their senile state. The multiethnic welfare states in North America were simply more vulnerable to the temptation to foist the costs of income redistribution on the private sector. They were able to do this, while inflaming a sense of grievance and entitlement, by blaming the structure of society as a whole, and white men in general, for the economic shortcomings of various subcultures within society.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

                <p>这指出了信息时代的另一个讽刺 —— 即自由市场的批评者对工业工作的兴衰所持的分裂和根本性的阻挠态度。在工业化的早期阶段，他们对所谓的工业工作的邪恶感到窒息，因为它吸引了无地农民离开『我们已经失去的世界』。听批评者说，工厂工作的出现是一种前所未有的邪恶和对工人阶级的『剥削』。但现在看来，唯一比工厂工作的出现更糟糕的事情是它们的消失。那些为工厂工作的出现而哀嚎的人的曾孙们，现在正在为工厂工作的短缺而哀嚎，这些工作为低技能的工作提供了高薪。</p>

                <!-- <p>The one coherent thread that runs through these complaints is a steadfast resistance to technological innovation and market change. In the early stages of the factory system, this resistance led to violence. It may again.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>贯穿这些抱怨的一条连贯线索是对技术创新和市场变化的坚定抵制。在工厂系统的早期阶段，这种抵抗导致了暴力。它可能再次发生。</p>

                <!-- <p>And not because capitalists are “exploiting the workers.” The advent of the computer as a paradigm technology revealed the absurdity of that claim. It might have been half-credible for the inattentive to suppose that a barely literate auto worker had somehow been “exploited” in the production of an automobile by owners who conceived and financed the businesses that employed workers. The crucial role of conceptual capital in the production and marketing of tangible products was less obvious than it is in the output of the Information Age, which clearly involves mental work. Therefore, the plausibility of the assumption that entrepreneurs had somehow seized the value of information products actually created by workers was much diminished. Where the value was clearly created through mental work, as in the production of consumer software, it was little short of preposterous to suppose that it was actually the product of anyone other than the skilled persons who conceived it. In fact, far from assuming that the workers created all value, as Marxists and socialists did through most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the obvious and growing trend away from unskilled employment gave rise to a spreading worry about quite the opposite problem—whether unskilled laborers still had any economic contribution to make.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en104" id="text00015.html#ch09en104">104</a></sup></p>

                <p>并非因为资本家在『剥削工人』。计算机作为一种范式技术的出现，揭示了这种说法的荒谬性。对于不注意的人来说，假设一个几乎不识字的汽车工人在生产汽车的过程中以某种方式被雇用工人的企业主『剥削』，这可能是半信半疑的。概念资本在有形产品的生产和销售中的关键作用不如在信息时代的产出中那么明显，后者显然涉及脑力劳动。因此，假设企业家以某种方式攫取了工人实际创造的信息产品的价值，这种说法的合理性就大打折扣。如果价值明显是通过脑力劳动创造的，比如在消费类软件的生产中，假设它实际上是构思该产品的技术工人以外的其他人的产品，那就太荒谬了。事实上，马克思主义者和社会主义者在十九世纪和二十世纪的大部分时间里，远远没有假定工人创造了所有的价值，明显的、日益增长的非技术性就业的趋势，引起了人们对完全相反的问题的担心
                    —— 非技术工人是否还有任何经济贡献。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en104" id="text00015.html#ch09en104">104</a></sup></p>

                <!-- <p>Hence the migration of the rationale for income redistribution away from “exploitation,” which assumed a productive competence for those with low incomes, to “discrimination,” which did not. “Discrimination,” however, was alleged to account for the failure of those with low skills to develop more valuable ones.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>因此，收入再分配的理由从『剥削』转移到了『歧视』，因为『剥削』假定低收入者具有生产能力。然而，『歧视』被指责为低技能者未能发展更有价值的技能的原因。</p>

                <!-- <p>This discrimination was also said to justify imposition of nonoptimal hiring criteria and other standards for opening “opportunity,” or, more precisely, redistributing income to the lagging groups. In the United States, for example, race-based norming of achievement and aptitude tests allowed blacks to outscore white and Asian applicants while registering lower objective scores. Through this method and others, governments obliged employers to hire more blacks and other officially “victimized” groups at higher wages than might otherwise have been the case. Anyone who failed to comply faced costly court actions, including lawsuits involving large punitive damages.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>这种『歧视』也被说成是强加非最佳雇用标准和其他标准以开辟『机会』的理由，或者更准确地说，将收入重新分配给落后的群体。例如，在美国，基于种族的成绩和能力测试的规范化允许黑人在客观分数较低的情况下超过白人和亚洲申请人。通过这种方法和其他方法，政府迫使雇主以更高的工资雇用更多的黑人和其他官方『受害』群体。任何不遵守规定的人都会面临昂贵的法庭诉讼，包括涉及大量惩罚性赔偿的诉讼。</p>

                <!-- <p>The point of designating victims was not to incubate paranoid delusions of persecution and grievance among important subgroups of industrial society, or to subsidize the spread of counterproductive values. It was to relieve the bankrupt state of the fiscal pressures of redistributing income. Inculcating delusions of persecution was merely an unfortunate side effect. Ironically, the surge in concern about “discrimination” coincided with the early stages of a technological revolution that is bound to make actual arbitrary discrimination far less of a problem than it has ever been before. No one on the Internet knows or cares whether the author of a new software program is black, white, male, female, homosexual, or a vegetarian dwarf.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>指定受害者的意义并不是要在工业社会的重要子群体中孵化出受迫害和不满的偏执妄想，也不是要补贴反作用的价值观的传播。它是为了减轻破产的国家在重新分配收入方面的财政压力。灌输迫害的错觉只是一个不幸的副作用。具有讽刺意味的是，对『歧视』关注的激增恰好与技术革命的早期阶段相吻合，而技术革命必将使实际的任意歧视比以前少得多。在互联网上，没有人知道或关心一个新的软件程序的作者是黑人、白人、男性、女性、同性恋，还是一个素食侏儒。</p>

                <!-- <p>While the reality of discrimination is bound to be less oppressive in the future, that will not necessarily relieve the pressure for “reparations” to compensate various real or imagined wrongs. Every society, whatever its objective circumstances, gives rise to one or more rationalizations for income redistribution. They range from the subtle to the absurd, from the biblical injunction to love your neighbor as yourself, to the invocations of black magic. Sorcery, witchcraft, and the evil eye are the flip side of religious feeling, the spiritual equivalent of the Inland Revenue or the IRS. When people cannot be moved by love to subsidize the poor, the poor themselves will try to see that they are moved by fear. Sometimes this takes the form of an outright shakedown, a knife to the throat, a gun to the head. At other times, the threat is disguised or fanciful. It is no coincidence that most of the “witches” of the early modern period were widows or unmarried women with few resources. They terrorized their neighbors with curses that not infrequently moved those neighbors to pay up. It is by no means obvious that those who did so were only the superstitious. The malevolent intent of the evil eye was not a superstition but a fact. Even a poor woman could loose cattle or set someone’s house ablaze. In that sense, the witchcraft trials of the early modem period were not altogether so preposterous as they seem. While the punishments were cruel and no doubt many innocents suffered from the hallucinations of neighbors under the influence of ergot poisoning, the prosecution of witches can be understood as an indirect way of prosecuting extortion.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>尽管现实中的歧视在未来必然会减少压迫性，但这并不一定会缓解要求『赔偿』的压力，以补偿各种真实或想象中的错误行为。每个社会，无论其客观情况如何，都会产生一种或多种收入再分配的合理化。它们的范围从微妙到荒谬，从《圣经》中爱邻如己的禁令，到黑魔法的召唤。巫术、女巫和邪恶之眼是宗教感情的反面，相当于税务局或国税局的精神。当人们不能被爱所感动而去补贴穷人时，穷人自己会试图看到他们被恐惧所感动。有时，这采取的形式是赤裸裸的敲诈，用刀抵住喉咙，用枪指着头。在其他时候，威胁是伪装的或虚构的。现代早期的大多数『女巫』都是寡妇或资源匮乏的未婚妇女，这并不是巧合。她们用诅咒恐吓她们的邻居，而这些诅咒往往会让这些邻居付出代价。绝不是说那些这样做的人只是迷信者。邪恶之眼的恶意并不是一种迷信，而是一种事实。即使是一个贫穷的女人，也可能放走牛群或放火烧掉别人的房子。从这个意义上说，现代早期的巫术审判并不完全像它们看起来那么荒唐。虽然惩罚是残酷的，而且毫无疑问，许多无辜的人在麦角中毒的影响下遭受了邻居的幻觉，但对女巫的起诉可以被理解为起诉勒索的间接方式。</p>

                <!-- <p>We expect a return of extortion motivated by a desire to share in the rewards of achievement as the Information Age unfolds. Groups that feel aggrieved over past discrimination are unlikely to quickly relinquish their apparently valuable status as victims simply because their claims on society become less justified or harder to enforce. They will continue to press their claims until evidence in the local environment leaves no doubt that they will no longer be rewarded.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>我们预计，随着信息时代的到来，以分享成就的愿望为动机的敲诈勒索行为将再次出现。对过去的歧视感到不满的群体不太可能仅仅因为他们对社会的要求变得不那么合理或更难执行而迅速放弃他们作为受害者的明显的宝贵地位。他们将继续坚持自己的要求，直到当地环境中的证据毫无疑问地表明他们将不再得到回报。</p>

                <!-- <p>The growth of sociopathic behavior among Afro-Americans and Afro-Canadians tells you that. It says that there is little balance between black anger and a realistic appraisal of the extent to which black problems are self-inflicted consequences of antisocial behavior.

The death of the nation-state and the disappearance of income redistribution on a large scale will no doubt lead some among the more psychopathic of these unhappy souls to strike out against anyone who appears more prosperous than they.

                <!-- <p>Given past experience of antitechnological rebellion in the early nineteenth century and the long tradition of collective violence in both Europe and North America, no one should be surprised to see a neo-Luddite attack upon information technology and those who use it. The Luddites, referred to earlier, were cloth workers concentrated in West Yorkshire, England, who launched a terrorist campaign against automated cropping machines and the factory owners who adopted them in 1811-12.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en106" id="text00015.html#ch09en106">106</a></sup>With blackened faces, the Luddites raged through West Yorkshire, burning factories and murdering factory owners who dared to adopt the new technology. Most of the violence was the work of “croppers,” highly skilled artisans whose labor in wielding gigantic scissors weighing up to fifty pounds was previously a crucial part of the production of woolen cloth. But the finishing work that the croppers performed, “raising the nap by teasels and cropping the cloth by shears,” was, as Robert Reid, author of the best and most comprehensive discussion of the Luddite rising, <em>Land of Lost Content: The Luddite Revolt 1812,</em>observed, “too simple not to be mechanized.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en107" id="text00015.html#ch09en107">107</a></sup>The design of one such mechanized cropping machine had been sketched out by Leonardo da Vinci. Yet Leonardo’s design for automatic cropping languished for centuries. Finally, by 1787, a device like Leonardo’s was reinvented and brought into production in England. As Reid notes, “so long had all the constituent parts of the technology been known that the surprise is that it had not been introduced earlier.… The new equipment of the Industrial Revolution required so little strength and skill to use that many job openings were taken by women and young children, initially at low wages. One of these new machines, even operated by the relatively unskilled, could now crop in eighteen hours what a skilled cropper using hand shears took eighty-eight hours to do.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en108" id="text00015.html#ch09en108">108</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>鉴于过去十九世纪初反技术叛乱的经验，以及欧洲和北美长期以来的集体暴力传统，看到新卢德分子对信息技术和使用它的人的攻击，没有人应该感到惊讶。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en106" id="text00015.html#ch09en106">106</a></sup>带着发黑的脸，卢德派在西约克郡肆虐，焚烧工厂，谋杀那些敢于采用新技术的工厂主。大多数暴力事件都是『裁缝』所为，这些高度熟练的工匠挥舞着重达 50 磅的巨大剪刀的劳动，以前是羊毛布生产的关键部分。但是，正如罗伯特·里德（
                    <em>Robert Reid</em>）所言，裁缝们所做的收尾工作，即『用茶刀提高棉絮，用剪子裁剪布匹』，是对卢德派崛起的最好和最全面的讨论（<em>Land of Lost Content</em>）。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en107" id="text00015.html#ch09en107">107</a></sup>达芬奇·莱昂纳多已经画出了这样一台机械化裁剪机的设计。然而，莱昂纳多的自动裁剪设计被搁置了几个世纪。最后，到了
                    1787 年，类似莱昂纳多的设备被重新发明并在英国投入生产。正如里德所指出的那样，『这项技术的所有组成部分早已为人所知，令人惊讶的是，它没有更早地被引进……』工业革命的新设备对力量和技能的要求非常低，许多工作机会被妇女和幼儿占据，最初工资很低。这些新机器中的一台，即使由相对不熟练的人操作，现在也能在 18 个小时内完成一个熟练的农夫用手剪所做的事情。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en108" id="text00015.html#ch09en108">108</a></sup></p>

                <!-- <p>Note that the workers who railed at mechanization were quite discriminating in their opposition to new technology. They only attacked and fought those technologies that displaced their own jobs or reduced the demand for skilled labor. When an entrepreneur named William Cooke introduced carpet-weaving machinery into the West Yorkshire district, this sparked no violence whatever. No attempts were made to burn Cooke’s mill, or destroy his machinery, much less murder him. As Robert Reid explains in his history of the Luddite uprisings, Cooke’s new technology excited no opposition because carpets were a product “in which no one in the valley had until then specialized.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en109" id="text00015.html#ch09en109">109</a></sup>Reid continues, “Because Cooke introduced a new product and created employment founded on no traditional practices whatever, his mill flourished.…”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en110" id="text00015.html#ch09en110">110</a></sup>This is an example with important application for the future. It suggests that thinking entrepreneurs in the next millennium will first introduce dramatic labor-saving automation in regions without a tradition of producing whatever product or service is in question.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>注意，抨击机械化的工人在反对新技术方面是相当有区别的。他们只攻击和打击那些取代他们自己的工作或减少对熟练劳动力需求的技术。当一位名叫威廉·库克（<em>William Cooke</em>）的企业家在西约克郡地区引进地毯编织机械时，没有引发任何暴力事件。没有人试图烧毁库克的工厂，或破坏他的机器，更没有人企图谋杀他。正如罗伯特·里德在他的《卢德起义史》中所解释的那样，库克的新技术没有引起任何反对，因为地毯是一种『直到那时哪怕在山谷中都还没有人擅长的产品。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en109" id="text00015.html#ch09en109">109</a></sup>里德继续说：『由于库克引进了一种新产品，并创造了不基于任何传统做法的就业，他的工厂蓬勃发展……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en110" id="text00015.html#ch09en110">110</a></sup>这是一个对未来有重要应用意义的例子。它表明，在下一个千年里，有思想的企业家将首先在没有生产任何产品或服务传统的地区引入巨大的节省劳动力的自动化。</p>

                <!-- <p>If the past is a guide, the most violent of the terrorists of the early decades of the new millennium will not be homeless paupers but displaced workers who formerly enjoyed middle-class incomes and status. This was certainly the case in the Luddite uprising of 1812, in which the bulk of the Luddites were not an impoverished proletariat but skilled artisans who were accustomed to earning incomes five times or more greater than those of an average worker. The equivalent group today would probably be displaced factory workers. Unfortunately, scanning the demographics of most OECD countries, one finds more areas than not that could be highlighted as potential sites of violent reaction.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>如果过去是一个指南，新千年早期几十年中最暴力的恐怖分子将不是无家可归的穷人，而是以前享有中产阶级收入和地位的流离失所的工人。1812 年的卢德起义当然就是这种情况，其中大部分卢德分子不是贫穷的无产阶级，而是习惯于赚取比普通工人多五倍或更多收入的熟练工匠。今天的同类群体可能是被淘汰的工厂工人。不幸的是，检索分析大多数 OECD 国家的人口统计数据，我们发现更多的地区可以被强调为潜在的暴力反应场所。</p>

A furious nationalist reaction will sweep the world. Part and parcel of it will be an antitechonological reaction equivalent to the Luddite and other antitechnology rebellions in Britain during the Industrial Revolution. This should be considered closely, because it could be a key to the evolution of governance in the new millennium. One of the crucial challenges of the great transformation ahead will be maintaining order in the face of escalating violence, or alternatively escaping its brunt. Individuals and firms that are particularly associated with the advent of the Information Age, including those in Silicon Valley, and even the suppliers of electricity required to power the new technology, will have to maintain a special diligence against free-lance, neo-Luddite terrorism.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

                <!-- <p>A lunatic like the Unabomber is unfortunately likely to stimulate brigades of imitators as frustration with falling incomes and resentment against achievement mount. We suspect much of the violence to come will involve bombings. As reported in the <em>New York Times</em>, domestic terrorism across the United States soared during the 1990s. “They increased by more than 50 percent in the last five years, and have nearly tripled over the last decade. The number of criminal explosions and attempts went from 1,103 in 1985 to 3,163 in 1994.…In small towns and suburban neighborhoods, as well as among inner-city street gangs, there has been a proliferation of a sort of garden variety bomber.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en111" id="text00015.html#ch09en111">111</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

The falling scale of violence implied by the new information technology makes the provision of a massive military establishment far less useful. This implies not only a declining decisiveness in warfare, meaning that states will be less able to actually protect citizens, it also implies that the apparent extraterritorial hegemony of the United States as the world’s superpower will be less effective in the next century than the hegemony of Great Britain was in the nineteenth century. Until the onset of World War I, power could be effectively and decisively projected from the core to the periphery at relatively low cost. In the twenty-first century, the threats that major powers pose to the safety of life and property will necessarily diminish with the return to violence. Falling returns to violence suggest that nation-states or empires capable of exercising military power on a large scale are unlikely to survive or come into being in the Information Age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Further, a wealthy individual or firm may be able to afford to hire protection against most threats that would be likely to arise in the Information Age. At the margin, the diminished scale of military threats will increase the danger of anarchy, or competitive violence within a single territory. But it will also intensify competition among jurisdictions in the provision of protection on competitive terms. This will mean intensified shopping among jurisdictions for protection services, passport and consular services, and the provision of justice.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>随着提供足够的防御的财政要求下降，将保护服务作为私人物品来对待将变得更加可信。毕竟，规模缩小的安全威胁将越来越多地由可以通过商业方式参与的安全部队来防御，例如通过使用墙壁、栅栏和安全围栏来屏蔽麻烦制造者。此外，一个富裕的个人或公司可能有能力雇用保护措施，以应对在信息时代可能出现的大多数威胁。在边际上，军事威胁的规模缩小将增加无政府状态的危险，或在单一领土国家内的竞争暴力。但它也将加剧各司法管辖区之间在竞争条件下提供保护的竞争。这将意味着司法管辖区之间在保护服务、护照和领事服务以及提供司法方面的竞争加剧。</p>

                <blockquote>

                    <!-- <p>In the use of violence there were obviously great advantages of scale when competing with rival violence-using enterprises or establishing a territorial monopoly. This fact is basic for the economic analysis of one aspect of government: the violence-using, violence-controlling industry was a natural monopoly, at least on land. Within territorial limits the service it rendered could be produced much more cheaply by a monopoly. To be sure, there have been times when violence-using enterprises competed in demanding payments for protection in almost the same territory, for example, during the Thirty Years’ War in Germany. But such a situation was even more uneconomic than would be competition in the same territories between rival telephone systems.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en112" id="text00015.html#ch09en112">112</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>在使用暴力方面，与使用暴力的对手企业竞争或建立领土国家垄断时，显然有很大的规模优势。这一事实是对政府的一个方面进行经济分析的基础：使用暴力、控制暴力的行业是一种自然垄断，至少在土地上是如此。在领土国家范围内，它所提供的服务可以由垄断者更便宜地生产。可以肯定的是，曾有过使用暴力的企业在几乎相同的领土国家上竞争要求支付保护费的情况，例如，在德国的三十年战争期间。但这种情况甚至比敌对的电话系统在同一地区的竞争更不经济。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en112" id="text00015.html#ch09en112">112</a></sup></p>

                <!-- <p>Lane’s comment is informative in two respects. Firstly, we agree with his general conclusion that sovereignties will tend to exercise territorial monopolies because doing so will allow them to offer cheaper and more effective protection services. The second interesting aspect of Lane’s comment is his dated comparison with monopoly telephone service. Obviously, we now know that telephone systems need not be monopolies. This introduces a caution into the analysis. Changes in technological conditions may to some extent obviate the general conclusion that anarchy within territorial limits is nonviable. For example, if cyberassets grow to large scale in a realm that puts them outside the reach of compulsion, the pricing of protection services may be much less a matter of “demand” and more a matter of market negotiation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>莱恩的评论在两个方面很有参考价值。首先，我们同意他的一般结论，即主权国家将倾向于行使领土国家垄断，因为这样做将使他们能够提供更便宜和更有效的保护服务。莱恩评论的第二个有趣方面是他与垄断电话服务的过时比较。显然，我们现在知道，电话系统不一定是垄断的。这在分析中引入了一个警告。技术条件的变化在某种程度上可能会使领土国家范围内的无政府状态是不可行的这一一般结论失效。例如，如果网络资产在某一领域发展到大规模，使其处于强制力的范围之外，那么保护服务的定价可能就不是『需求』的问题，而是市场谈判的问题了。</p>

                <!-- <p>Nonetheless, what we refer to here is something different from generalized anarchy—namely, competition among jurisdictions, each enjoying a monopoly of violence in its own territory. We see such jurisdictions competing to offer the greatest value possible in the cost-effective provision of protection services that appeal to their “customers.” Admittedly, there will no doubt be greater ambiguities in the provision of protection services in the Information Age, with more complete private provision of policing and defense services than we have been accustomed to seeing before. Yet the competition we envision is different from a clash of multiple protection agencies battling on a large scale to provide service to different customers in the same territory, which is <em>anarchy.</em></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>尽管如此，我们在这里所指的是与普遍的无政府状态不同的东西 —— 即司法管辖区之间的竞争，每个司法管辖区都在自己的领土国家上享有对暴力的垄断。我们看到这些司法管辖区在竞争中尽可能提供最大的价值，以低成本的方式提供吸引其『客户』的保护服务。诚然，在信息时代，保护服务的提供无疑会有更大的模糊性，私人提供的治安和防御服务比我们以前习惯看到的更完整。然而，我们所设想的竞争与多个保护机构为在同一地区向不同客户提供服务而进行大规模争夺的冲突不同，后者是『无政府状态』。</p>

                <!-- <p>Be that as it may, the multiplication of sovereignties, with individuals assuming more of the role of sovereigns in cases when they accumulate sufficient resources, inevitably implies that there will be an increase in the scope for anarchy in the world. The relations between sovereignties are always anarchic. There is not and never has been a world government regulating the behavior of individual sovereignties, whether ministates, nation-states, or empires. As Jack Hirshleifer writes, “While associations ranging from primitive tribes to modern nation-states are all governed internally by some form of law, their external relations with one another remain mainly anarchic.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en113" id="text00015.html#ch09en113">113</a></sup>When there are more sovereign entities in the world, inevitably more relations transpire in more than one jurisdiction and are therefore anarchic.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>尽管如此，主权国家的增多，以及个人在积累足够资源的情况下承担更多的主权国家角色，不可避免地意味着世界上无政府状态的范围会增加。主权国之间的关系总是无政府主义的。现在和过去都没有一个世界政府来规范单个主权国家的行为，无论是小国、领土国家，还是帝国。正如 Jack Hirshleifer 所写的那样，『虽然从原始部落到现代领土国家的协会都受到某种形式的法律的内部管理，但它们彼此之间的外部关系仍然主要是无政府状态。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en113" id="text00015.html#ch09en113">113</a></sup>当世界上的主权实体越多，不可避免地会在一个以上的管辖区发生更多的关系，因此是无政府状态的。</p>

                <!-- <p>It is important to note that anarchy, or the lack of an overwhelming power to arbitrate disputes, is not synonymous with total chaos or the absence of form or organization. Hirshleifer notes that anarchy can be analyzed: “intertribal or international systems also have their regularities and systematic analyzable patterns.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en114" id="text00015.html#ch09en114">114</a></sup>In other words, just as “chaos” in mathematics can entail an intricate and highly ordered form of organization, so “anarchy” is not entirely formless or disordered.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>重要的是要注意，无政府状态，或缺乏一个压倒性的权力来仲裁争端，并不是完全混乱或没有形式或组织的同义词。Hirshleifer 指出，可以对无政府状态进行分析。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en114" id="text00015.html#ch09en114">114</a></sup>换句话说，正如数学中的『混乱』可以带来复杂而高度有序的组织形式一样，『无政府状态』也不是完全没有形式或无序的。</p>

                <!-- <p>Hirshleifer analyzes a number of anarchic settings. These include, in addition to relations among sovereignties, gang warfare in Prohibition-era Chicago and “miners versus claim jumpers in the California gold rush.” Note that even though California was part of the United States by the onset of the gold rush in 1849, conditions in the goldfields were properly described as anarchy. As Hirshleifer notes, “The official organs of law were impotent.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en115" id="text00015.html#ch09en115">115</a></sup>He argues that topographical conditions in the mountainous camps, plus effective vigilante organization by miners to combat claim jumpers, made it difficult for gangs of outsiders to seize gold mines, in spite of the lack of effective law enforcement. In other words, under certain conditions, valuable property can be effectively protected even under anarchy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>Hirshleifer 分析了一些无政府状态的环境。其中除了主权国家之间的关系外，还包括禁酒令时代芝加哥的帮派战争和『加州淘金热中的矿工与跳楼者』。请注意，即使加利福尼亚在 1849 年淘金热开始时是美国的一部分，但金矿区的情况被恰当地描述为无政府状态。正如 Hirshleifer 所指出的，『官方的法律机关是无能为力的。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en115" id="text00015.html#ch09en115">115</a></sup>他认为，山区营地的地形条件，加上矿工为打击抢占者而进行的有效治安组织，使得外来者的团伙很难抢占金矿，尽管缺乏有效执法。换句话说，在某些条件下，即使在无政府状态下，有价值的财产也能得到有效保护。</p>

                <!-- <p>The question is whether Hirshleifer’s theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the spontaneous order of the Darwinian “natural economy” is of any relevance to the economy of the Information Age. We suspect it is. While we do not anticipate generalized anarchy, or goldfield conditions everywhere, we do anticipate an increase in the number of anarchic relations in the world system. In light of this expectation, Hirshleifer’s argument about conditions under which “two or more anarchic contestants” can “retain viable shares of the socially available resources in equilibrium” is suggestive.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en116" id="text00015.html#ch09en116">116</a></sup>In particular, he explores when anarchy is prone to “break down” into <em>tyranny</em>or dominance hierarchies, which happens when the anarchic parties can be subdued by an overwhelming authority.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>问题是 Hirshleifer 对达尔文『自然经济』的自发秩序的理论分析是否与信息时代的经济有任何关联。我们怀疑它是。虽然我们没有预料到普遍的无政府状态，或到处都是金矿的情况，但我们确实预料到世界体系中无政府关系的数量会增加。鉴于这种预期，Hirshleifer 关于『两个或更多的无政府竞争者』能够『在平衡中保留社会可用资源的可行份额』的条件的论点是有提示性的。<sup><a href="html#ch09-en116" id="text00015.html#ch09en116">116</a></sup>特别是，他探讨了无政府状态何时容易『分解』为『暴政』或统治等级，这发生在无政府状态的各方可以被压倒性的权威所制服。</p>

                <!-- <p>These issues may be more important to understand in the Information Age than they were in the Industrial Age. Part of the reason that the finer distinctions about the dynamics of anarchy were less crucial in recent centuries than they may be in the new millennium is precisely because the returns to violence were rising through the modern period. This meant that massing larger and larger military forces, as nation-states did in recent centuries, tended to make for decisive warfare. Decisive warfare, almost by definition, subdues anarchy by placing contestants for the control of resources under the domination of a more powerful authority. On the other hand, declining decisiveness in battle, which corresponds to the superiority of the defense in military technology, contributes to the dynamic stability of anarchy. Therefore, the apparent impact of information technology in reducing the decisiveness of military action should make the anarchy between minisovereignties more stable and less prone to be replaced through conquest by a large government. Less decisiveness in battle also implies less fighting, which is an encouraging deduction for the world in the Information Age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>这些问题在信息时代可能比在工业时代更需要理解。关于无政府状态动态的细微区别在最近几个世纪中没有那么关键，而在新的千年中可能是如此，部分原因正是因为在现代时期，暴力的回报率在上升。这意味着，像领土国家在近几个世纪所做的那样，集结越来越大的军事力量，往往会带来决定性的战争。根据定义，决定性的战争通过将资源控制权的竞争者置于一个更强大的权力机构的统治之下而制服了无政府状态。另一方面，与军事技术方面的防御优势相对应的战斗中的下降的决定性，有助于无政府状态的动态稳定。因此，信息技术在降低军事行动的决定性方面的明显影响应该使小国之间的无政府状态更加稳定，不容易被大国政府通过征服而取代。战斗的决定性降低也意味着战斗的减少，这对信息时代的世界来说是一个令人鼓舞的推论。</p>

                <!-- <h3>Viability</h3><span class="english"></span> -->
                <h3>可行性</h3>

                <!-- <p>Another important condition for anarchy to be sustained is viability or income adequacy. Individuals who lack a sufficient income to sustain life are likely either to (1) devote a great deal of effort to fighting in order to seize enough resources to survive, or (2) capitulate to another contestant in exchange for food and sustenance. Something similar to this occured with the rise of feudalism during the transformation of the year 1000. We expect increasing numbers of low-income persons in Western countries who previously would have depended upon transfer payments from the state to affiliate with wealthy households as retainers. Nonetheless, the mere fact of inviability by some contenders in a Hobbesian melee (or war of all against all) is inconclusive. As Hirshleifer says, “The mere fact of low income under anarchy,… of itself provides no clear indication as to what is likely to happen next.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en117" id="text00015.html#ch09en117">117</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>无政府状态得以持续的另一个重要条件是生存能力或收入的充足性。缺乏足够收入来维持生活的人，很可能会（<em>1</em>）投入大量精力进行战斗，以夺取足够的资源来生存，或者（<em>2</em>）向另一个竞争者屈服，以换取食物和养料。在 1000 年的变革中，封建主义的兴起也发生了类似的情况。我们预计，在西方国家，越来越多的低收入者以前会依靠国家的转移支付，作为家臣与富人家庭联系。尽管如此，在霍布斯式的混战（或所有人对所有人的战争）中，仅仅是一些竞争者无法生存的事实并不确定。正如
                    Hirshleifer 所说，『在无政府状态下，仅仅是收入低的事实本身并不能清楚地表明接下来可能会发生什么。』

                <h3>资产的特征</h3>

                <!-- <p>Still another interesting condition for the sustainability of anarchy is that resources be “predictable and defendable.” In Hirshleifer’s analysis, “Anarchy is a social arrangement in which contenders struggle to conquer and defend durable resources.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en118" id="text00015.html#ch09en118">118</a></sup>He defines “durable resources” to include “land territories or movable capital goods.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en119" id="text00015.html#ch09en119">119</a></sup>In the Information Age, digital resources may prove to be predictable, but they will not be “durable resources” of the kind that Hirshleifer identifies with territoriality and anarchy. Indeed, if digital money can be transferred anywhere on the planet at the speed of light, conquest of the territory in which a cyberbank is incorporated may be a waste of time. Nation-states wishing to suppress Sovereign Individuals would have to seize simultaneously both the world’s banking havens and its data havens. Even then, if encrypted systems are designed properly, nation-states would merely be able to sabotage or destroy certain sums of digital money, not seize it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>无政府状态可持续发展的另一个有趣的条件是，资源是『可预测和可防御的』。在 Hirshleifer 的分析中，『无政府状态是一种社会安排，其中竞争者为征服和捍卫持久的资源而斗争。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en118" id="text00015.html#ch09en118">118</a></sup>他将『持久资源』定义为『包括土地领土国家或可移动资本货物。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch09-en119" id="text00015.html#ch09en119">119</a></sup>在信息时代，数字资源可能被证明是可预测的，但它们不会是
                    Hirshleifer 所认定的领土国家性和无政府状态的那种『持久资源』。事实上，如果数字货币可以以光速转移到地球上的任何地方，那么对网络银行所在领土国家的征服可能是浪费时间的。希望压制主权个体的领土国家将不得不同时夺取世界上的银行避风港和数据避风港。即使如此，如果加密系统设计得当，领土国家也只能破坏或摧毁某些数量的数字货币，而不是夺取它们。</p>

                <!-- <p>Over the long term, however, we doubt that the leading nation-states will succeed in suppressing Sovereign Individuals. For one tiling, existing states, especially in capital-poor regions, will find that they have more to gain by harboring Sovereign Individuals than by maintaining solidarity with the North Atlantic nation-states and upholding the sanctity of the “international” system. The fact that bankrupt, high-tax welfare states want to keep “their citizens” and “their capital” in “their country” will not be a compelling motive to be observed by hundreds of fragmenting sovereignties elsewhere.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>然而，从长远来看，我们怀疑领先的领土国家能否成功地压制主权个体。首先，现有的国家，尤其是资本贫乏地区的国家，将发现它们通过庇护『主权个体』比通过与北大西洋领土国家保持团结和维护『国际』体系的神圣性更有好处。破产的高税收福利国家希望将『他们的公民』和『他们的资本』留在『他们的国家』，这一事实将不会成为其他地方数百个支离破碎的主权国家所遵守的令人信服的动机。</p>

There can be little doubt that some of these organizations, like the European Union and the World Bank, are influential. But remember that the jurisdictions that make Sovereign Individuals welcome stand to benefit significantly from their presence. Even a pigheaded power like the United States, which is bound by current trends to work vigorously to prevent the emergence of a cybereconomy outside the control of the U.S. government, will ultimately not wish to exclude those residents of the globe with positive bank balances who do not wish to be Americans.

                <!-- <p>We believe that the age of the nation-state is over, but this is not to say that the attraction of nationalism as a tug on human emotions will be immediately quieted. As an ideology, nationalism is well placed to draw upon universal emotional needs. We have all had the experience of awe, such as one might feel on first seeing a giant waterfall, or first standing at the entrance to a great cathedral. We have all had the experience of belonging, such as we might feel at a family Christmas party, or as a member of a successful team in some sport. Human culture calls for a response to both of these powerful emotions. We are illuminated by the historic culture of our own country, which is itself part of the larger culture of humanity. We are comforted by the knowledge that we belong to a cultural group, which gives us both a sense of participation and of identity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>我们认为，领土国家的时代已经结束，但这并不是说民族主义作为一种对人类情感的牵引，其吸引力将立即得到平息。作为一种意识形态，民族主义完全可以利用普遍的情感需求。我们都有过敬畏的经历，比如第一次看到巨大的瀑布，或者第一次站在大教堂的门口，都会有这种感觉。我们都有过归属感的体验，比如我们在家庭圣诞聚会上，或者作为某个运动项目的成功团队的成员，可能会有这种感觉。人类文化要求对这两种强大的情感做出回应。我们被自己国家的历史文化所照亮，它本身就是人类大文化的一部分。我们因知道自己属于一个文化群体而感到安慰，这使我们有了参与感和认同感。</p>

                <!-- <p>The impact of these cultural symbols can have the strongest emotional effect. The American associations of the Flag, the National Anthem, or the family feast at Thanksgiving Day, the English associations of the monarchy or cricket—all have a real hold on the imaginations of American and English people, respectively, a hold that is reinforced by repetition and goes deep into the subconscious mind. Such symbols help to tell us what sort of people we are, and remind us of a national culture. When anti—Vietnam War demonstrators wanted to shock the rest of the United States, they burned the flag. Alienated English attack the monarchy, and have even been known to dig holes in cricket pitches.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>这些文化符号的影响可以产生最强烈的情感效果。美国人对国旗、国歌或感恩节的家宴的联想，英国人对君主制或板球的联想，都分别对美国人和英国人的想象力产生了真正的影响，这种影响通过重复得到加强，并深入到潜意识中。这样的符号有助于告诉我们是什么样的人，并提醒我们一个民族的文化。当反越战的示威者想要震撼美国其他地区时，他们烧毁了国旗。被疏远的英国人攻击君主制，甚至被称为在板球场上挖洞。</p>

                <!-- <p>This is hardly a comprehensive catalogue of the conditions under which democracy can exist. If it were, democracy would not have become a triumpliant system at the end of the twentieth century. Weapons were arguably more expensive in the twilight of the industrial era than ever. And many of the most effective weapons definitely required specialists to be used effectively. Furthermore, the Gulf War between the United States, its allies, and Iraq proved how vulnerable large contingents of infantry are, even when nestled in trenches and dug-in fortifications. So why has democracy appeared to flourish under these conditions as the twentieth century winds down?</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                <p>这几乎是一份关于民主可以存在的条件的全面目录。如果是这样的话，民主在二十世纪末就不会成为一个独立的体系。可以说，在工业时代的尾声，武器比以往任何时候都要昂贵。而且许多最有效的武器肯定需要专家才能有效使用。此外，美国、其盟国和伊拉克之间的海湾战争证明了大型步兵队伍是多么脆弱，即使是依偎在战壕和挖好的工事里。那么，为什么在二十世纪即将结束的时候，民主似乎在这些条件下得到了发展？

                    <!-- <p>We offered a paradoxical explanation in Chapter 5, namely that democracy flourished as a fraternal twin of Communism precisely because it facilitated unimpeded control of resources by the state. This conclusion may seem silly to the Manchichaean “common sense” of the industrial era. We do not deny that within the terms of industrial society, democratic systems and Communism were stark opposites. But seen from a megapolitical perspective, as they may more likely be seen from the vantage of the Information Age, the two systems had more in common than, you would have been led to suspect.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>我们在第五章提供了一个自相矛盾的解释，即民主作为共产主义的兄弟姐妹而繁荣，正是因为它促进了国家对资源的无障碍控制。这个结论对于工业时代的满清『常识』来说可能显得很愚蠢。我们并不否认，在工业社会的条件下，民主制度和共产主义是截然相反的。但是，从跨政治的角度来看，正如从信息时代的角度来看，这两种制度的共同点比你所怀疑的要多。</p>

                    <!-- <p>In a setting where weaponry was grotesquely expensive, democracy became the decision mechanism that maximized control of resources by the state. Like state socialism, democratic systems made available huge sums to fund a massive military establishment. The difference was that the democratic welfare state placed even greater resources in the hands of the state than could the state socialist systems. That is saying something, because the state socialist or Communist systems laid claim to practically every asset worth having.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>在一个武器装备极其昂贵的环境中，民主成为使国家最大限度地控制资源的决策机制。像国家社会主义一样，民主制度提供了巨额资金来资助大规模的军事机构。不同的是，与国家社会主义制度相比，民主福利国家将更多的资源掌握在国家手中。这说明了一些问题，因为国家社会主义或共产主义制度几乎对所有值得拥有的资产都提出了要求。</p>

                    <!-- <p>Seen dispassionately, democracy was superior to state socialism as a recipe for enriching the state. As we explained earlier, democracy made substantially more money available to the military because democracy was compatible with private ownership and capitalist productivity.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>冷静地看，民主制度比国家社会主义制度更胜一筹，因为它是使国家致富的良方。正如我们前面所解释的那样，民主制度为军队提供了大量的资金，因为民主制度与私有制和资本主义生产力相适应。</p>

                    <!-- <p>The state socialist system was predicated upon the doctrine that the state owned everything. The democratic welfare state, by contrast, made more limited initial claims. It pretended to allow private ownership, although of a contingent kind, and thereby harnessed superior incentives to mobilize output. Instead of mismanaging everything from the start, democratic governments in the West allowed individuals to own property and accumulate wealth. Only after the wealth had been created did the democratic nation-states step in to tax a large fraction of it away.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>国家社会主义制度是以国家拥有一切的理论为前提的。相比之下，民主的福利国家在最初提出的要求更为有限。它假装允许私人所有权，尽管是一种偶然的所有权，从而利用优越的激励机制来调动产出。西方的民主政府没有从一开始就管理不善，而是允许个人拥有财产和积累财富。只有在财富被创造出来之后，民主领土国家才会介入，对其中的一大部分征税。</p>

                    <!-- <p>The word “Large” should be capitalized. For example, in 1996 the lifetime federal tax rate at the highest brackets in the United States stood at seventy-three cents on the dollar. For owners of corporations, who received their income through dividends, the rate was eighty-three cents on the dollar. And for anyone who sought to leave or give wealth to grandchildren, the federal tax rate was ninety-three cents on the dollar. When state and local taxes are considered as well, democratic government at all levels confiscates the lion’s share of each dollar earned in the United States. Predatory tax rates made the democratic state a <em>de facto</em>partner with a three-quarters to nine-tenths share in earnings. This was not the same thing as state socialism, to be sure. But it was a close relation.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>『大部分』中的『大』字应该用特大字号。例如，在 1996 年，美国最高等级的终身联邦税率为每美元七十三美分。对于通过分红获得收入的公司所有者来说，税率为每美元八十三美分。而对于任何想把财富留给孙子女的人来说，联邦税率是每美元九十三美分。如果把州和地方税也考虑在内，各级民主政府没收了在美国赚取的每一美元中的绝大部分份额。掠夺性的税率使民主国家成为<strong>事实上的</strong>伙伴，在收入中占有四分之三到十分之九的份额。可以肯定的是，这与国家社会主义不是一回事。但它是一种密切的关系。</p>

                    <!-- <p>The democratic state survived longer because it was more flexible and collected more prodigious quantities of resources compared to those available in Moscow or East Berlin.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

                    <!-- <p>We have described the megapolitical advantages of democracy as a decision rule for a powerful government as “inefficiency, where it counted.” Compared to Communism, the welfare state was indeed a far more efficient system. But compared to a genuine laissez-faire enclave like colonial Hong Kong, the welfare state was inefficient. Growth rates in Hong Kong were fabulous, but their superiority lay precisely in the fact that the resident of Hong Kong, not the government, was able to pocket 85 percent of the benefits of faster growth.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>我们曾将民主作为强大政府的决策规则的跨政治优势描述为『效率低下』。与共产主义相比，福利国家的确是一个效率高得多的系统。但与殖民地时期的香港这样一块真正的自由放任的飞地相比，福利国家是没有效率的。香港的增长率是惊人的，但其优越性恰恰在于，香港居民，而不是政府，能够将更快增长的 85% 的利益收入囊中。</p>

                    <!-- <p>Hong Kong, of course, was never a democracy. Indeed, it is a mental model of the kind of jurisdiction that we expect to see flourish in the Information Age. In the Industrial Age, Hong Kong had no need to be a democracy, as it was spared the unpleasant necessity of gathering resources to support a formidable military establishment. Hong Kong was defended from the outside, so it could afford to maintain a really free economy.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

                    <!-- <p>It was precisely the capacity to rake in resources that made democracy supreme during the megapolitical conditions of the Industrial Age. Mass democracy went hand in hand with industrialism. As Alvin Toffler has said, mass democracy “is the political expression of mass production, mass distribution, mass consumption, mass education, mass media, mass entertainment, and all the rest.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en4" id="text00016.html#ch10en4">4</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

                    <!-- <p>Now that information technology is displacing mass production, it is logical to expect the twilight of mass democracy.

                    <!-- <p>A moment’s reflection shows that the technology of the Information Age is not inherently a mass technology. In military terms, as we have indicated, it opens the potential for “smart weapons” and “Information War,” in which “logic bombs” could sabotage centralized command and control systems. Not only does information technology clearly point toward the perfection of weapons operated by specialists; it also reduces the decisiveness of warfare, improving the relative position of the defense. Microtechnology makes possible dramatic gains in the military power of individuals, while reducing the importance of massed infantry formations. As the Rand Corporation reported to the secretary of defense: “Interconnected networks may be subject to attack and disruption not just by states but also by nonstate actors, including dispersed groups and even individuals.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en5" id="text00016.html#ch10en5">5</a></sup>What is more, this implies that cyberwar will realize the potential diseconomies to scale inherent in mass, centralized systems.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>稍加思考就会发现，信息时代的技术在本质上并不是一种大众技术。在军事方面，正如我们所指出的，它为『智能武器』和『信息战争』开辟了潜力，其中『逻辑炸弹』可以破坏集中的指挥和控制系统。信息技术不仅清楚地指向由专家操作的武器的完善；它还降低了战争的决定性，改善了防御的相对地位。微观技术使个人军事力量的大幅提高成为可能，同时降低了大规模步兵编队的重要性。正如兰德公司向国防部长报告的那样：『互联网络不仅可能受到国家的攻击和破坏，也可能受到非国家行为者的攻击和破坏，包括分散的团体甚至个人。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en5" id="text00016.html#ch10en5">5</a></sup>此外，这意味着网络战争将实现大规模、集中式系统所固有的潜在规模不经济性。</p>

Peoria may be far from any potential military front, but it will no longer be safe from cyberattack by almost any potential antagonist. Residing within the borders of a superpower will mean putting yourself within the bull’s-eye. Instead of federating, locales may make themselves more secure by disaggregating. The advent of cyberwar will increase the vulnerability of centralized command-and-control systems, while increasing the competitive viability of dispersed systems.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>用兰德专家的话说，『基于信息的技术使地理距离变得无关紧要；美国大陆的目标与战区内的目标一样脆弱。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en6" id="text00016.html#ch10en6">6</a></sup>过去，在美国这样的大型超级大国的边界内居住意味着安全，在信息时代，权力聚合的逻辑可能被颠覆。皮奥里亚可能远离任何潜在的军事前线，但它将不再是安全的，几乎任何潜在的对手的网络攻击。居住在一个超级大国的边界内将意味着把自己放在靶心上。与其说是联合，不如说是通过分解来使自己更安全。网络战争的出现将增加集中式指挥和控制系统的脆弱性，同时增加分散式系统的竞争活力。</p>

                    <!-- <p>The feedback mechanisms this will stimulate could accelerate the devolutionary process. As the Rand experts suggest, in order to lessen the vulnerability to cyberattack of the command-and-control systems that have evolved during the late stages of the nation-state, governments will be obliged to increase “the exploitation of new software encryption techniques.” This will make these mainly private-sector systems far less vulnerable to sabotage, while accelerating the commercial dispersion of hard encryption, which will help free them from state domination. This, too, will give impetus to devolution. As we argued earlier, it will further propel the dispersion of resources into cyberspace, where they will be beyond the reach of politics.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>这将刺激的反馈机制可能会加速权力下放的进程。正如兰德专家所建议的，为了减少在领土国家后期发展起来的指挥和控制系统对网络攻击的脆弱性，政府将不得不增加『对新软件加密技术的利用』。这将使这些主要是私营部门的系统更不容易受到破坏，同时加速硬加密技术的商业传播，这将有助于使它们摆脱国家的控制。这也将推动权力下放。正如我们之前所论述的，它将进一步推动资源向网络空间的分散，在那里它们将是政治所不能及的。</p>

The “losers” or “left-behinds” are perfect constituents, geographically concentrated and politically needy. The history of industrial democracy confirms this. “Winners” from new industries were chronically underrepresented in legislative deliberations even in the high tide of the Industrial Age in the 1930s.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en8" id="text00016.html#ch10en8">8</a></sup>The tendency of politicians to represent the existing, established competitors, not the new enterprises that might come into being or the potential customers of new enterprises, is probably an inherent feature of representative government.

Indeed, many of the dynamic personalities of the new economy are unlikely to be citizens of even the most encompassing jurisdiction.

                    <!-- <p>What might such new institutions be? To understand, forget anything you read in misnamed “political science” texts. The new institutions of governance for the Information Age will trespass the boundaries of conventional thinking. The progress toward such institutions of the new age has already begun. They are little-recognized improvisations for restructuring underutilized assets, the benefits of sovereignty. The world’s nation-states, anxiously looking over their shoulders at secession movements and the powerful forces of devolution, have clubbed together to form the strongest border-fixing cartel that they can possibly enforce. While the number of new states in the world has increased in the 1990s, this happened mainly in two clusters, thanks to the collapse of multiethnic Communist dictatorships in the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. It is notable that other leading nation-states, including the United States, maneuvered to preserve the Soviet Union for as long as possible. And few governments welcomed the breakup of Yugoslavia. The independence of the former Yugoslav republics was recognized only after secessionists had wrested control that they could enforce through their own military efforts. The leading powers were content to see unarmed or poorly armed separatists slaughtered by their Serb tormentors. Even faraway China, a powerful nation-state with no direct interest in preserving the rump of Yugoslavia, vigorously opposed efforts to achieve self-determination for oppressed ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Ironically, this border-fixing fetish is more likely to dictate the path of devolution to fragmented sovereignty than to actually forestall devolution. The fierce resistance of vulnerable nation-states across the globe to overt secession and political disaggregation makes recognized sovereignty a valuable form of transcendental capital that can be voluntarily fragmented and sublet by the states possessing it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>这种新机构可能是什么？要了解这一点，请忘掉你在名不副实的『政治学』教科书中读到的任何东西。信息时代的新治理机构将突破传统思维的界限。朝着新时代的这种机构的进展已经开始了。它们是重组未被充分利用的资产 —— 主权的好处 —— 的鲜为人知的即兴之作。世界上的领土国家对分离运动和权力下放的强大力量忧心忡忡，已经联合起来，形成了他们可能实施的最强大的边界固定卡特尔。虽然世界上新国家的数量在二十世纪 90 年代有所增加，但这主要发生在两个集群中，由于前苏联和南斯拉夫的多民族共产主义独裁政权的崩溃。值得注意的是，包括美国在内的其他主要领土国家都在操纵，尽可能长时间地保留苏联。而很少有政府欢迎南斯拉夫的解体。前南斯拉夫各共和国的独立只有在分离主义者夺取了他们可以通过自己的军事努力实施的控制权之后才得到承认。主要大国满足于看到手无寸铁或武装薄弱的分离主义者被他们的塞族折磨者所屠杀。即使是遥远的中国，一个强大的领土国家，在维护南斯拉夫的残余部分方面没有直接的利益，也极力反对为科索沃受压迫的阿尔巴尼亚族人实现自决的努力。具有讽刺意味的是，这种固守边界的癖好更有可能支配向分散的主权移交的道路，而不是实际阻止移交。全球脆弱的领土国家对公开的分离和政治分解的激烈抵制，使得公认的主权成为一种宝贵的超验资本，可以被拥有它的国家自愿分割和转租。</p>

                    <!-- <p>An example of how sovereignty can be voluntarily fragmented to create essentially private, tax-free jurisdiction is the Agulhas Bay Concession Free Zone, comprising fifty square kilometers of the island of Principe off the coast of West Africa. Although the territory remains within the borders of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, the administration of the zone is privatized. Governance there is determined according to contract administered by WADCO, the West African Development Corporation Ltd., a private company chartered in South Africa. The language of record in the zone is not the official Tomean tongue, Portuguese, but English. The currency of record is not the Tomean local Monopoly money, the dobra, but the globe’s money, the U.S. dollar. Security is provided not by police forces of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Principe, but by private police employed by WADCO. São Tomean commercial law is inapplicable to commercial dealings within the zone, and São Tomean courts have no jurisdiction. All disputes must be settled by transnational arbitration, under the Paris ICC rules. With a few tightly regulated and trivial exceptions, São Tomean taxes do not apply within the zone, nor do official monopolies. Telecommunications, for example, are automatically deregulated within the zone. Subject to the payment of rent and adherence to other terms of the concession, WADCO is entitled to automatically and repetitively renew its lease on private, fragmented sovereignty for terms of fifty years, from the first renewal date, 2047.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>阿古哈斯湾特许自由区就是一个例子，它包括西非海岸的普林西比岛的 50 平方公里，说明主权可以被自愿分割，以创造基本上是私人的、免税的管辖权。虽然该领土国家仍在圣多美和普林西比民主共和国的边界内，但该区的管理是私有化的。那里的管理是根据 WADCO（西非发展有限公司）管理的合同决定的，WADCO 是一家在南非注册的私人公司。该区的记录语言不是多米尼加的官方语言葡萄牙语，而是英语。记录在案的货币不是多美尼加当地的大富翁货币 —— 多布拉，而是全球货币 —— 美元。安全不是由圣多美和普林西比民主共和国的警察部队提供，而是由
                        WADCO 雇用的私人警察提供。圣多美商业法不适用于该区的商业交易，圣多美法院没有管辖权。所有的争端都必须根据巴黎国际商会的规则，通过跨国仲裁解决。除了少数受到严格管制和微不足道的例外情况，圣多美和官方垄断也不适用于该区。例如，电信在区内自动解除管制。在支付租金和遵守特许权的其他条款的前提下，WADCO 有权自动和重复地延长其对私人的、零散的主权的租赁，期限为 50 年，从第一个延长日期 2047 年开始。</p>

                    <!-- <p>What-WADCO has achieved in São Tomé and Principe can and will be matched by others in many different jurisdictions. One of the true pioneers of twenty-first-century development, Joaquin Aguirre has created a similar zone of private sovereignty in the Central Aguirre Portuaria, in eastern Bolivia. Aguirre, a multimillionaire, novelist, and inventor, a cofounder of the United Nations, and a former Senator of the Bolivian Republic, is a pioneer many times over. Half a century after he helped to found the United Nations, Aguirre is now a prototype for the Sovereign Individual of the twenty-first century. His Zona Franca, which is free of most Bolivian taxes, duties, and regulatory impositions, points the way toward the new form of privatized city-state which will increasingly be achieved by successful individuals in the Information Age. It also demonstrates conclusively that the lives of the masses, so often eulogized by the apologists of big government, can be dramatically improved by the economic development catalyzed by free trade zones such as that launched by Señor Aguirre. As time passes, the number of de facto city states in the world will multiply significantly. Indeed, if you achieve sufficient financial independence as an individual, you will be able to achieve ultimate independence, like Joaquin Aguirre. In the event that no one else’s piece of fragmented, commercialized sovereignty offers you a comfortable home base, you can launch your own proprietary ministate, as independent as any dukedom of the Middle Ages. Instead of playing tug-of-war with demagogues and political hacks to keep your assets from being wrested away and divided among the many clamoring hands of mass democracy, you will be able to establish your own private realm of governance.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>WADCO 在圣多美和普林西比所取得的成就，可以并将由许多不同的司法管辖区的其他公司来效仿。Joaquin Aguirre 是二十一世纪发展的真正先锋之一，他在玻利维亚东部的 Central Aguirre Portuaria 创建了一个类似的私人主权区。阿吉雷是一位千万富翁、小说家和发明家，是联合国的共同创始人，也是玻利维亚共和国的前参议员，他是一个多次的先驱者。在他帮助建立联合国的半个世纪后，阿吉雷现在是二十一世纪主权个体的原型。他的『法兰西区』免去了玻利维亚的大部分税收、关税和监管措施，为新形式的私有化城邦指明了方向，在信息时代，成功的个人将越来越多地实现这一目标。它还确凿地表明，大政府的辩护人经常讴歌的大众生活，可以通过阿吉雷先生发起的自由贸易区所催化的经济发展得到极大的改善。随着时间的推移，世界上事实上的城市国家的数量将大大增加。事实上，如果你作为一个人实现了足够的经济独立，你将能够像华金·阿吉雷一样实现最终的独立。
                        如果没有人的一块碎片化、商业化的主权为你提供一个舒适的大本营，你可以启动你自己的专属小国，就像中世纪的任何公爵一样独立。你将能够建立自己的私人治理领域，而不是与煽动者和政治黑客进行拉锯战，以防止你的资产被大众民主的许多喧嚣的手所夺走和分割。

                    <!-- <p>The dramatic phase change from mass democracy to the ultimate form of self-government, individual sovereignty, need not involve a radical shift in public opinion, nor a miraculous vote, by disenchanted electors opting to scrap mass democracy. Such a revolution can begin, indeed, already has begun, invisibly, with the leasing of sovereign territory for use as tax-free zones, “Zona Francas,” and free ports. In due course, sovereignty will fragment repeatedly until it is so completely fissured that dividing it further would not yield a value sufficient to offset the transaction costs of devolution. Given Moore’s Law and Gilder’s Corollary, that bandwidth triples each year, there is no basis at present to foresee any early end to the devolutionary trend. To the contrary, we anticipate that the apparently solid power of nation-states currently devoted to mass democracy will splinter in tens of thousands of fragments into a system more reminiscent of the medieval period than the modern industrial age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

                    <!-- <p>In due course, even nation-states that retain rump institutions of mass democracy will experience a significant shift in policies to accommodate the new metaconstitutional realities. As William Keech, a faithful advocate of democracy, argues in <em>Economic Politics: The Costs of Democracy:</em>“People learn to want what they see they can get, but they can also change their minds if they see that they do not like what they wanted and what they got.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en12" id="text00016.html#ch10en12">12</a></sup>In other words, the fact that mass democracy with conventional institutions of representative government is hailed everywhere as the twentieth century draws to an end could be a “sell signal.” It by no means assures that such decision rules will stand the test of time, even in their own terms. Remember, when you look outside politics, there is scarcely any evidence of executives, administrators, coaches, or other professional leaders being selected democratically. To the contrary, the most successful leaders are routinely hired by proprietors through selection processes in which those with the greatest interests at stake have an unequal and disproportionately greater say in determining the outcome. If democratic selection were truly a superior method to identify competent leaders, you would expect to see it as a universal decision rule. Instead, it is confined almost solely to the political realm. In short, it is more reasonable on current evidence to assume that the provision of sovereignty services is hobbled by the dominance of democratic decision-making than it is to assume the opposite, namely, that corporate and business organizations suffer, because they are run by executives installed by proprietors rather than according to a show of hands.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>在适当的时候，即使是那些保留了大众民主的残余机构的领土国家也会经历政策上的重大转变，以适应新的元宪政现实。正如民主的忠实拥护者威廉·基奇（<em>William Keech</em>）在《经济政治》（Eem>Economic Politics）一书中所论述的。民主的代价：</em>『人们学会了想要他们所看到的可以得到的东西，但如果他们看到他们不喜欢他们想要的和得到的东西，他们也可以改变主意。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en12" id="text00016.html#ch10en12">12</a></sup>换言之，在二十世纪即将结束时，具有传统代议制政府机构的大众民主到处受到欢迎，这可能是一个『出售信号。』
                        它绝不能保证这种决策规则会经受住时间的考验，即使是以它们自己的名义。请记住，当你看向政治之外，几乎没有任何证据表明高管、行政人员、教练或其他专业领导人是通过民主方式选择的。恰恰相反，最成功的领导人通常是由经营者通过选拔过程雇用的，在这个过程中，那些拥有最大利益的人在决定结果方面拥有不平等和不成比例的发言权。如果民主选拔真的是识别有能力的领导人的一种优越方法，你会期望看到它成为一种普遍的决策规则。相反，它几乎只局限于政治领域。简而言之，根据目前的证据，假设主权服务的提供因民主决策的主导地位而受到阻碍，要比假设相反的情况更合理，即公司和商业组织受到影响，因为它们是由经营者任命的高管而不是根据举手表决来管理的。

                    <!-- <p>By the middle of the twenty-first century it is likely that the proliferation of proprietary jurisdictions of fragmented sovereignty will have conclusively demonstrated the advantages of proprietary administration. Voters will see that they suffer for being saddled with mass democracy. Therefore, as Professor Keech suggests, they will come to see that the benefits derived from employee control of government are outweighed by its costs. They will migrate toward reform. Even electorates in Europe and North America that now seem so strongly committed against reform could eventually vote to make their regions more accommodating to proprietary governance. Majorities may willingly, even gladly abandon the farce of politics in favor of proprietary management of government which actually aims toward achieving the optimum setting for concluding and enforcing contracts.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
                    <p>到了二十一世纪中叶，主权分散的专有管辖区的激增很可能会最终证明专有管理的优势。选民们将看到，他们会因为被大众民主所束缚而受苦。因此，正如 Keech 教授所建议的那样，他们将看到雇员控制政府所带来的好处是大于其成本的。他们将走向改革。即使是欧洲和北美的选民，现在看起来如此强烈地反对改革，最终也会投票使他们的地区更适合于专有管理。多数人可能愿意，甚至高兴地放弃政治的闹剧，支持政府的专有管理，这实际上是为了实现缔结和执行合同的最佳设置。</p>

In any marginally free economy, consumers can act to express their desires directly by purchasing services and products. Or by withdrawing their custom.

It also undoes the slogan so confidently expressed by American nationalists in the 1960s, “Love it or leave it.” By imposing penal taxes on those who leave, the exit tax is meant to compel loyalty.

After all, it is economically in the interest of any sovereignty that economically productive persons remain within its territory and create value rather than departing to a more welcoming jurisdiction. In other words, the exit tax could become the model for a lump-sum buyout. The government imposing an exit tax would realize far higher benefits by allowing those exiting to resume residence under terms of a private treaty like those currently available in Switzerland and elsewhere.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

At the end of the Middle Ages, voices were raised in support of reviving chivalry.

If our theory of megapolitics is valid, the reason the modem age, with its concept of citizenship and politics organized around the state, supplanted the feudal system and chivalry organized around personal oaths and relationships was not a matter of ideas, but shifts in costs and benefits arising from new technology. Chivalry did not the because Castiglione or others failed to convince a disinterested populace who had any control over the matter that there was no need for honor or morality in the affairs of state. To the contrary, Castiglione’s <em>Courtier</em>is critical of princes and the kind of behavior his contemporary, Niccolo Machiavelli, commended in his <em>II Principe,</em>or <em>The Prince.</em>But so what? Machiavelli ultimately reached a larger audience with his book, not because his argument in <em>The Prince</em>was more eloquent but because his advice better suited the megapolitical conditions of the modern age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Machiavelli endorsed conduct that proved well suited to the nature of politics in an age of power.

            <p>简而言之，《君主论》是一部激进的作品，它阐明了一个现代配方，有志于此的统治者可以不惜牺牲他人的利益，成功地推进自己的事业。马基雅弗利认可的行为被证明很适合权力时代的政治性质。但是，作为现代政治家的精明政策，双重间谍的艺术在前几个世纪成长起来的骑士精神文化方面是离谱的、颠覆性的。</p>

            <!-- <p>As we explored earlier, the virtues of chivalry included an emphasis on extreme fidelity to oaths. This was a necessity in a society where protection was organized in exchange for personal services. The bargains upon which feudal society rested were not such that they would have reemerged spontaneously among people free to determine where their best interests lay under conditions of duress. Therefore, feudal commitments that were the basis of chivalry had to be shorn up with a strong sense of honor. In that context, little could have been more subversive than Machiavelli’s suggestion that the Prince should not hesitate to lie, cheat, and steal when so doing served his interests.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如我们前面所探讨的，骑士精神的美德包括强调对誓言的极端忠诚。在一个以个人服务换取保护的社会中，这是一种必要。封建社会赖以生存的交易并不是这样的，它们会在人们中自发地重新出现，在胁迫的条件下自由决定他们的最佳利益所在。因此，作为骑士精神基础的封建承诺必须要有强烈的荣誉感。在这种情况下，没有什么比马基雅弗利的建议更具颠覆性了，他认为王子应该毫不犹豫地撒谎、欺骗和偷窃，只要这样做符合他的利益。</p>

            <!-- <p>As the twentieth century drew to a close, Machiavelli’s arguments were still being examined for their importance in understanding modern politics and various twentieth-century crimes and tyrannies.

            <!-- <p>Sometime within the next few decades, the new megapolitics of the Information Age will antiquate <em>The Prince.</em>The Sovereign Individual will require a new recipe for success, one which will highly emphasize honor and rectitude in deploying resources outside the grip of the state.

Even a resort hotel owned or controlled by its employees, like the typical modern democracy, would try in vain to force customers to comply with such demands, especially after better accommodations became available. If the customers would rather play golf than do heavy labor in the hot sun, then on that question, at least, the market offers little scope for imposing arbitrary alternatives.

            <p>我们已经讨论过拉施在《精英的反叛与民主的背叛》中提出的论点。但他并不是唯一支持领土国家的抨击者。哈佛大学政治理论家迈克尔·桑德尔（<em>Michael Sandel</em>）在《民主的不满》（<em>Democracy's Discontent</em>）中认为，『如果没有一个能够控制全球经济力量的政治，今天的民主是不可能的，因为没有这种控制，人们投票给谁并不重要，公司会统治。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en27" id="text00016.html#ch10en27">27</a></sup>换言之，国家必须保留其对个人的寄生权力，以确保政治结果能与市场结果相背离。不然的话，迫使非经济结果的集体决定将毫无意义。</p>

            <!-- <p>In our view, Sandel’s lament, like that of Lasch, is no more than half right. We concede that democracy will lose much of its importance if governments lack the power to compel individuals to behave as politicians insist. This is obvious. Indeed, democracy as it has been known in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is destined to disappear. But Sandel misses the real importance of the triumph of markets over compulsion. His invocation of “corporate rule” as a danger attendant upon the collapse of the nation-state is strikingly anachronistic.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在我们看来，桑德尔的感叹和拉什的感叹一样，不过是对了一半。我们承认，如果政府缺乏迫使个人按照政治家的要求行事的权力，那么民主将失去其大部分的重要性。这一点是显而易见的。事实上，十九世纪和二十世纪所知道的民主注定要消失。但桑德尔忽略了市场战胜强制力的真正重要性。他把『公司统治』作为领土国家崩溃后的一个危险来援引，这明显是不合时宜的。</p>

            <!-- <p>Corporations will hardly be in a position to rule the markets of the new global economy. Indeed, as we have suggested, it is far from obvious that corporations will even continue to exist in their familiar modern form. Far from it. Firms are almost bound to be transformed in the megapolitical revolution that comes with the introduction of the Information Age. As we have previously discussed, microprocessing will alter the “information costs” that help determine the “nexus of contracts” that define firms. As economists Michael C. Jensen and William H. Meckling suggest, corporations are merely one legal form that provides “a nexus for a set of contracting relationships among individuals.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en28" id="text00016.html#ch10en28">28</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

Jensen</em>）和威廉·H·梅克林（<em>William H. Meckling</em>）所言，公司只是一种法律形式，为『个人之间的一系列契约关系提供了一个纽带。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en28" id="text00016.html#ch10en28">28</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Whether the corporation can even survive, much less “rule” as “a domain of bureaucratic direction that is shielded from market forces,” is itself likely to be determined, in the words of economists Louis Putterman and Randall S. Kroszner, by “the completeness of market forces and the ability of market forces to penetrate intrafirm relationships.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en29" id="text00016.html#ch10en29">29</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>As we argued earlier, it is doubtful that firms will be able to survive the increasing penetration of market forces into what have heretofore been “intrafirm relationships.” As a result, firms will tend to dissolve as information technology makes it more rewarding to rely upon the price mechanism and the auction market to undertake tasks that need doing rather than having them internalized within a formal organization. As information technology increasingly automates the production process, it will take away part of the <em>raison d’être</em>of the firm, the need to employ and motivate managers to monitor individual workers.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>正如我们之前所论证的那样，企业能否在市场力量日益渗透到迄今为止的『企业内部关系』中生存下来是值得怀疑的。因此，企业将趋于解体，因为信息技术使得依靠价格机制和拍卖市场来承担需要完成的任务，而不是将其内化为一个正式的组织，更有意义。随着信息技术越来越多地使生产过程自动化，它将夺走公司的部分『存在理由』，即需要雇用和激励经理人来监督个别工人。</p>

            <h3>为什么会有公司</h3>

            <!-- <p>Remember, the question “Why are there firms?” is not as trivial as it may seem on casual observation. Microeconomics generally assumes that the price mechanism is the most effective means of coordinating resources for their most valued uses. As Putterman and Kroszner observe, this tends to imply that organizations like firms have no inherent “economic <em>raison d’être</em>”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en30" id="text00016.html#ch10en30">30</a></sup>In this sense, firms are mainly artifacts of information and transaction costs, which information technologies tend to reduce drastically.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>请记住，『为什么会有公司？』这个问题并不像偶然观察到的那样微不足道。微观经济学通常假定，价格机制是协调资源用于其最有价值的用途的最有效手段。正如 Putterman 和 Kroszner 所观察到的，这往往意味着像公司这样的组织没有内在的『经济上存在理由』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch10-en30" id="text00016.html#ch10en30">30</a></sup>在这个意义上，公司主要是信息和交易成本的产物，而信息技术往往能极大地减少这些费用。</p>

            <!-- <p>Therefore, the Information Age will tend to be the age of independent contractors without “jobs” with long-lasting “firms.” Equally, when economic success depends upon talented individuals, they may receive outsized pay and extravagant bonuses to provide their services, much as professional athletes and movie stars command huge rewards for their talents. In any event, as technology lowers transaction costs, the very process that will enable individuals to escape from domination by politicians will also prevent “rule by corporations.” Corporations will compete with “virtual corporations” from across the globe to a degree that will disturb and threaten all but a few. Most corporations as institutions will be lucky to survive intensified competition as markets become more complete.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，信息时代将倾向于成为没有『工作』的独立承包商和长期『公司』的时代。同样，当经济的成功取决于有才华的个人时，他们可能会得到超额的报酬和奢侈的奖金来提供他们的服务，就像职业运动员和电影明星因其才华而获得巨大的回报一样。在任何情况下，随着技术降低交易成本，使个人摆脱政治家统治的过程也将防止『公司统治』。公司将与来自全球各地的『虚拟公司』竞争，其程度将扰乱和威胁到除少数人之外的所有人。随着市场变得更加完善，大多数公司作为机构能够在激烈的竞争中生存下来将是幸运的。</p>

            <!-- <p>The consequence to be expected is not that individuals will be at the mercy of corporations. To the contrary. Corporations, per se, will have no more power to rig markets than politicians. It is rather that individuals will finally be free to determine their own destinies in a truly free market, ruled neither by big governments nor corporate hierarchies.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>可以预期的后果不是个人将任由公司摆布。恰恰相反。公司本身不会比政治家有更多的权力来操纵市场。相反，个人将最终在一个真正的自由市场中自由地决定自己的命运，既不受大政府的统治，也不受公司等级制度的约束。</p>

            <!-- <p>This erosion of transaction costs will also put the lie to recently fashionable notions of “stakeholder capitalism.” Such notions, dear to Tony Blair of Britain’s Labour Party as well as some within Bill Clinton’s entourage, are predicated upon the ability of the state to manipulate the corporation. Socialism having collapsed, interventionists now dream of achieving the ends of socialism through more market-efficient means by heavily regulating the firm. This new redistributive theory holds that the management, shareholders, employees, and “community” are all “stakeholders” of firms. The argument is that they all derive benefits from long-lasting firms, and even depend upon these benefits. Therefore, regulation ought to protect the stakes that managers, employees, and local taxing authorities have in the continuation of their historic relations with the firms.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种交易成本的侵蚀也将使最近流行的『利益相关者资本主义』的概念成为谎言。英国工党的托尼·布莱尔以及比尔·克林顿的一些随从都很喜欢这种观念，它们的前提是国家有能力操纵公司。社会主义已经崩溃，干预主义者现在梦想着通过更有市场效率的手段来实现社会主义的目的，对公司进行严格的监管。这种新的再分配理论认为，管理层、股东、雇员和『社区』都是公司的『利益相关者』。其论点是，他们都从长期存在的公司中获得了利益，甚至依赖于这些利益。因此，监管应该保护管理者、雇员和地方税收部门在继续保持他们与企业的历史关系中的利益。</p>

            <!-- <p>“Stakeholder capitalism” is a doctrine that ultimately presupposes not only an ability of the state to manipulate the decision-making of corporations, but even more basically presupposes the existence of corporations as long-standing organizations capable of functioning independently of price signals in the auction market.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『利益相关者资本主义』是一种理论，它最终不仅预设了国家操纵企业决策的能力，而且更基本的是预设了企业作为长期存在的组织，能够独立于拍卖市场的价格信号而运作。</p>

            <!-- <p>We suspect that the deepening of markets will not only diminish the taxing capacity of the nation-state, it will also erode the capacity of politicians to impose their will arbitrarily upon the owners of resources by regulation. In a world where jurisdictional advantages will be subject to market tests, and many local markets will be opened to competition from anywhere, it is hardly to be expected that local “communities” will have many effective ways of isolating favored firms from global competitive pressures. Therefore, they will have few ways of assuring that corporations lumbered with higher costs (for example, to retain unnecessary employees and management personnel, and keep unneeded facilities open to accommodate local political pressures) will be able to offset those costs and stay in business. In the Industrial Age, politicians could close markets and restrict entry to a few favored firms to meet employment and other objectives. In the future, when information will be freely tradable anywhere on the globe, the power of governments to insulate local businesses from global competitive pressures will be minimal.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>我们怀疑，市场的深化不仅会削弱领土国家的征税能力，也会削弱政治家通过监管将其意愿任意强加给资源所有者的能力。在一个管辖权优势将受到市场检验的世界里，许多地方市场将向任何地方的竞争开放，很难预期地方『社区』将有许多有效的方法将受青睐的公司与全球竞争压力隔离开。因此，他们将很少有办法保证那些负担较高成本的公司（例如，保留不必要的雇员和管理人员，并保持不需要的设施开放，以适应当地的政治压力）将能够抵消这些成本并保持业务。在工业时代，政治家可以关闭市场，限制少数受青睐的公司进入，以满足就业和其他目标。在未来，当信息可以在全球任何地方自由交易时，政府使当地企业免受全球竞争压力的权力将变得微乎其微。</p>

This is unlikely, both for competitive and other reasons. For one thing, with locational advantages mostly dissipated by technology, jurisdictions that fail to provide essential public goods, such as maintenance of law and order, will rapidly lose customers. In the most extreme failures, such as those already evidenced in Somalia, Liberia, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, hordes of penniless refugees are likely to spill over borders seeking more satisfactory provision of law and order.

In retrospect, some of these goods will prove to have been private goods in disguise. Highways represent a key example. So long as congestion was a minor problem, roads and highways could be treated as if they were public goods, albeit subject to the criticisms leveled by Adam Smith that they disproportionally benefit those living nearby at the expense of those in remote regions who are dragooned into paying for them while enjoying few of the benefits.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>微技术本身将促进新的融资和监管手段，以提供过去被视为公共产品的商品。回过头来看，其中一些商品将被证明是变相的私人商品。高速公路就是一个重要的例子。只要交通拥堵问题不大，道路和高速公路就可以被当作公共产品来对待，尽管会受到亚当·斯密的批评，即它们使住在附近的人不成比例地受益，而偏远地区的人则被拖着为它们付钱，却几乎享受不到任何好处。</p>

Thus the provision transportation infrastructure could be discretely privatized and financed directly by those who use the service.

It now disguises and masks the collapse of the nation-state. For a variety of reasons, the news media cannot always be depended upon to tell you the truth. Many are conservative in the sense that they represent the party of the past. Some are blinded by anachronistic ideological commitments to socialism and the nation-state. Some will be afraid for more tangible reasons to reveal the corruption that is likely to loom ever larger in a decaying system. Some will lack physical courage that might be required for such a task. Others will fear for their jobs or be shy of other retribution for speaking up.

            <!-- <p>As the barriers to transmission of information have fallen, there has been more of it, which is good. But there has also been more confusion about what it means. The modern technology that helps liberate information from political controls and impediments of time and place also tends to raise the value of old-fashioned judgment. The kind of insight that helps discern what is important and true from the mountain of facts and fantasies is growing in value almost daily. This is true for at least three reasons:</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>随着信息传输障碍的减少，信息的数量也越来越多，这是件好事。但是，对于信息的含义也有了更多的困惑。现代技术有助于将信息从政治控制和时间、地点的障碍中解放出来，同时也倾向于提高老式判断的价值。那种有助于从堆积如山的事实和幻想中分辨出什么是重要和真实的洞察力几乎每天都在增长。这是真的，至少有三个原因：</p>

            <!-- <p>1. The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise as possible. Unfortunately, abbreviated information often provides a poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five-second soundbites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket score much more easily than you can explain how baseball or cricket is played and what it means.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>1. 现在可获得的信息过剩，使人们更重视简洁。简洁性导致了缩略性。缩略语忽略了不熟悉的内容。当你有许多事实需要消化，有许多电话需要回访时，自然希望使每个信息处理事件尽可能地简洁。不幸的是，简略的信息往往为理解提供了一个糟糕的基础。历史上更深层、更丰富的纹理恰恰是那些在 25 秒的音节中容易被编辑掉的部分，以及在 CNN 上被误解的部分。传达一个已经被理解的主题的变种信息要比探索一个新的理解范式容易得多。你可以报告一个棒球或板球的比分，而不是解释棒球或板球是如何进行的以及它意味着什么。</p>

As a consequence, broad paradigmatic understanding, or unspoken theories about the way the world works, are being antiquated more quickly than in the past. This increases the importance of the broad overview and diminishes the value of individual “facts” of the kind that are readily available to almost anyone with an information retrieval system.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>2、快速变化的技术正在破坏社会和经济组织的跨政治基础。因此，广泛的范式理解，或关于世界运作方式的不言而喻的理论，正在比过去更快地过时。这增加了广泛概述的重要性，并降低了个人『事实』的价值，因为几乎所有拥有信息检索系统的人都能轻易获得这种『事实』。</p>

            <!-- <p>3. The growing tribalization and marginalization of life have had a stunting effect on discourse, and even on thinking. Many people have consequently gotten into the habit of shying away from conclusions that are obviously implied by the facts at their disposal. A recent psychological study disguised as a public opinion poll showed that members of individual occupational groups were almost uniformly unwilling to accept any conclusion that implied a loss of income for them, no matter how airtight the logic supporting it. Given increased specialization, most of the interpretive information about most specialized occupational groups is designed to cater to the interests of the groups themselves. They have little interest in views that might be impolite, unprofitable, or politically incorrect. There is no better example of this general tendency than the broad drumbeat of views implying bright prospects for investing in the stock market. Most of that information is generated by brokerage firms, few of which will tell you that stocks are overvalued. Their income is derived from transaction business that depends on the majority of customers being ready to buy. Independent, contrary voices are seldom heard.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>3. 生活中日益增长的部落化和边缘化对话语，甚至是思维都产生了阻碍作用。许多人因此养成了习惯，对他们所掌握的事实所明显暗示的结论避而不谈。最近一项伪装成民意调查的心理学研究表明，个别职业群体的成员几乎一致不愿意接受任何意味着他们收入损失的结论，无论支持这一结论的逻辑多么严密。鉴于专业化程度的提高，关于大多数专业化职业群体的大部分解释信息都是为了迎合这些群体本身的利益。他们对那些可能不礼貌、无利可图或政治上不正确的观点没有兴趣。这种普遍趋势的最好例子莫过于暗示投资股市前景光明的观点的广泛鼓动。这些信息大部分是由经纪公司提供的，其中很少有公司会告诉你股票被高估了。他们的收入来自于交易业务，而交易业务取决于大多数客户是否准备购买。很少听到独立的、相反的声音。</p>

            <!-- <p>For these and other reasons, the Age of Information has not yet become the Age of Understanding. To the contrary, there has been a sharp drop-off in the rigor of public discourse. The world now could know more than at any time in the past. But there is almost no public voice left to assess the meaning of events and say what is true.

Hirshleifer, an authority on conflict, put it this way: “The persistence of crime, war and politics teaches us that actual human affairs still remain largely subject to the underlying pressures of natural economy.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en3" id="text00017.html#ch11en3">3</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>For good and for ill, by making large-scale military power less decisive, information technology has radically reduced the capacity of the nation-state to impose its authority in an unruly world. If once, as Voltaire said, God was “on the side of bigger battalions,” there appears to be less divine support with every day that passes for generating large returns to violence. Instead, we see the opposite—more evidence of diminishing returns to violence—which strongly implies that large conglomerations like the nation-state will no longer justify their huge overhead costs.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>不管是好是坏，通过使大规模的军事力量不再具有决定性，信息技术从根本上降低了领土国家在一个不守规矩的世界上强加其权威的能力。如果像伏尔泰所说的那样，上帝曾经『站在更大的阵营一边』，那么，随着时间的推移，产生大量暴力回报的神圣支持似乎越来越少。相反，我们看到的是相反的情况 —— 更多的证据表明，暴力的回报在减少 —— 这强烈地暗示，像领土国家这样的大型集团将不再可能支撑其巨大的管理成本。</p>

            <!-- <p>The most obvious evidence of the declining decisiveness of centralized power is the rise of terrorism. High-profile bombings in the United States in the mid-nineties show that even the world’s military superpower is not immune from attack.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>中央集权的决定性下降的最明显证据是恐怖主义的崛起。九十年代中期在美国发生的引人注目的爆炸事件表明，即使是世界上的军事超级大国也不能免于攻击。</p>

            <!-- <p>Another important manifestation of falling returns to violence is the worldwide growth of gangsterism and organized crime, along with its corollary, political cronyism and corruption. They reflect a generally amoral atmosphere in which the state can coerce but not protect. As its monopoly of violence frays, new competitors edge into the scene, like the bully-boys who tried to impose their own private taxes on the American businessman in Moscow.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>暴力回报率下降的另一个重要表现是黑帮和有组织犯罪在世界范围内的增长，以及其必然结果 —— 政治裙带关系和腐败。它们反映了一种普遍的非道德氛围，在这种氛围中，国家可以强制但不能保护。随着国家对暴力的垄断逐渐消失，新的竞争者也开始出现，比如那些试图对莫斯科的美国商人征收自己的私人税的恶霸。</p>

They will exercise far more real power in the “natural economy” of the next millennium than they did in the twentieth century. Weapons that employ microchips have tended to shift the balance of power toward the defense, making decisive aggression less profitable and therefore less likely. Smart weapons, like Stinger missiles, for example, effectively neutralize much of the advantage that large, wealthy states formerly enjoyed in deploying expensive air power to attack poorer, smaller groups.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

As societies become more dependent upon computerized controls, “logic bombs” could do almost as much damage as physical explosions.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

As the scale of warfare falls, defense and protection will be mounted at a smaller scale. Therefore, they will increasingly be private rather than public goods, provided on a for-profit basis by private contractors. This is already evident in the privatization of policing in North America. One of the more rapidly growing occupations in the United States is the “security guard.” Projections indicate that the number of private security guards will increase 24 percent to 40 percent above 1990 levels by the year 2005.<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en8" id="text00017.html#ch11en8">8</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

The probability of Hillary Rodham’s having made her trades legitimately, they calculated, was less than one in 250,000,000.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en22" id="text00017.html#ch11en22">22</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>While the world as a whole draws back from the disturbing conclusion that the President of the United States is tainted by close association with organized crime and criminals, that is what the evidence suggests. Morris quotes a former U.S. Attorney who tracked organized crime figures and their interests. He claims that Clinton’s election as governor in 1984 “was the election when the mob really came into Arkansas politics, the dog-track and racetrack boys, the payoff people who saw a good thing… it went beyond our old Dixie Mafia, which was penny-ante by comparison. This was eastern and West Coast crime money that noticed the possibilities just like the legitimate corporations did.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en28" id="text00017.html#ch11en28">28</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>虽然整个世界对美国总统因与有组织犯罪和犯罪分子有密切联系而受到玷污这一令人不安的结论退避三舍，但这正是证据所表明的。莫里斯引用了一位追踪有组织犯罪人物及其利益的前美国检察官的话。他声称，克林顿在 1984 年当选州长时，『正是黑帮真正进入阿肯色州政治的选举，那些跑狗场和赛马场的男孩，那些看到好事的收买者…… 的时候。他们超越了我们古老的迪克西黑手党，相比之下，黑手党简直是穷光蛋。这些东部和西海岸的犯罪资金注意到了像合法公司那样赚钱的可能性。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en28" id="text00017.html#ch11en28">28</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Apparently, others of like mind have continued to notice the possibilities with Clinton. <em>New York</em>magazine, following an earlier piece in <em>Reader’s Digest,</em>reports that “the president’s key allies in the trade-union movement are also men affiliated with what to all appearances are some of the dirtiest, most mobbed-up unions in America.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en29" id="text00017.html#ch11en29">29</a></sup>Of particular interest is Clinton’s close relationship with Arthur Coia.

            <p>显然，其他有同样想法的人也不断注意到克林顿的可能性。《纽约》杂志，继《读者文摘》的早期文章之后，报道说：『总统在工会运动中的关键盟友也是隶属于美国最肮脏、最暴徒的一些工会的人。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en29" id="text00017.html#ch11en29">29</a></sup>特别值得关注的是克林顿与阿瑟·科亚的密切关系。科亚是克林顿的『主要筹款人』之一，他是北美劳工国际联盟的主席，『这是劳工史上最浮夸的腐败工会之一。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en30" id="text00017.html#ch11en30">30</a></sup></p>

            <!-- <p>Apparently, the Justice Department under Mr. Clinton struck what <em>New York</em>describes as a “weirdly generous deal” with Coia “to keep his job in the face of compelling charges from that very same Justice Department that he is a long-time associate of organized-crime figures.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch11-en31" id="text00017.html#ch11en31">31</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>In the long run, political corruption at the highest levels makes nonsense of conventional celebration of the possibilities of democracy for the deliberate mastery of public problems. In the Information Age it will be much less important that government be large and powerful than that it be honest.

            <p>从长远来看，最高层的政治腐败使传统上对民主的可能性的赞美成为无稽之谈，而民主是对公共问题的有意掌握。在信息时代，政府的规模和权力将远不如它的诚实重要。政府在历史上提供的大部分服务注定要在下一个千年里转入私人市场。但是，从世界各地的证据来看，你是否能长期依赖一个腐败的系统和腐败的领导人来保障你的家庭和投资，这一点是值得怀疑的。</p>

The other obvious implication of the Information Revolution for morality is an increased vulnerability that comes with the possibility of cybercommerce and virtual corporations communicating with unbreakable encryption.

Unlike the usual situation that prevailed in Western societies through most of the past two centuries, criminals are not merely misfits, without social standing. When crime pays, you tend to get a better class of criminal because little social odium attaches to crime. The Sicilian Mafia, for example, along with many drug dealers who employ local labor at inflated rates, command respect and popular support on their home turf.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

Countries and groups that achieve successful development do so partly because they have an ethic that encourages the economic virtues of self-reliance, hard work, family and social responsibility, high savings, and honesty. This is also true of social subgroups. The business success of Jews, particularly of religious Jews, of the Puritans in New England, of the Quakers in British business in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, or of the Mormons in modern America, all show the economic benefits that result from cultures with a strong moral framework.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>One can take the Quakers as an example. The Quakers became successful businesswise, and were particularly successful as bankers, for a number of reasons. They set themselves the highest possible standard of trustworthiness. They would not swear oaths, but regarded every business commitment as being as binding as an oath. “My word is my bond” was for them an absolute principle. They believed in a quiet style of living, decent but frugal. As a religious duty, they avoided spending money on the vanities of this world. They avoided quarrels, and thought war was always sinful. They thought that the businessman had a moral obligation to give fair value, and as merchants they developed a reputation for maintaining high quality with moderate prices. “Caveat emptor”—let the buyer beware—was not good enough for them. In an age when most merchants followed a high-price, high-margin theory of trade, the Quaker morality led them naturally to a low-margin, high-turnover policy. As Henry Ford later showed, this can be potentially far more profitable. They followed this business policy because they thought it their duty not to cheat their customer, but it turned out to be the best way to expand their businesses. The Quakers proved good people to do business with, so their customers came back; there were profits on both sides. As a high-saving community, which honored its obligations, the Quakers had an advantage as bankers, and membership in the Quakers was itself a business asset which inspired confidence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>人们可以把教友会作为一个例子。贵格会（<em>Quakers</em>）成员在商业上获得了成功，而且作为银行家特别成功，原因有很多。他们为自己设定了尽可能高的可信度标准。他们不会宣誓，但把每一个商业承诺都视为与宣誓一样具有约束力。对他们来说，『我的话就是我的保证』是一个绝对的原则。他们相信一种安静的生活方式，体面而节俭。作为一项宗教义务，他们避免把钱花在这个世界的虚荣上。他们避免争吵，并认为战争总是罪恶的。他们认为商人有道德上的义务给予公平的价值，作为商人，他们在保持高质量和适度的价格方面形成了声誉。<em>Caveat emptor</em>                —— 让买方当心 —— 对他们来说是不够的。在一个大多数商人遵循高价格、高利润的贸易理论的时代，贵格会的道德观使他们自然而然地采取了低利润、高营业额的政策。正如亨利·福特后来表明的那样，这可能是潜在的更大的利润。他们遵循这种商业政策，因为他们认为不欺骗客户是他们的责任，但事实证明这是拓展业务的最佳方式。事实证明，贵格会的人很会做生意，所以他们的客户又回来了；双方都有利润。作为一个高储蓄率的社区，贵格会履行其义务，作为银行家具有优势，而贵格会的成员资格本身就是一种商业资产，可以激发人们的信心。</p>

            <!-- <p>Unfortunately such business advantages can be eroded by the very success they produce. Countries go through a cycle, which formed the basis of Adam Ferguson’s sociological theory in the eighteenth century, from poverty and hard work, to riches, to luxury, to decadence, and on to decline. The ancient Romans themselves looked back to the virtues of the Republican period, when the Empire was being built, and deplored the luxury and laziness that they regarded as the cause of their decline. This erosion of the industrious virtues by prosperity can happen surprisingly quickly. The Germans are still a capable and efficient people, but they are not working anything like as hard as they did when they were rebuilding their country after the rain of defeat in 1945. In two generations, they have gone from working long hours, almost with their bare hands, in conditions of acute poverty, to working short hours for the highest pay and the most expensive welfare on earth.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>不幸的是，这种商业优势可能会被其产生的成功所侵蚀。国家会经历一个周期，这也是十八世纪亚当·弗格森的社会学理论的基础，即从贫穷和辛勤工作到富裕，到奢侈，到颓废，再到衰退。古罗马人自己回顾了共和国时期的美德，当时帝国正在建立，并对奢侈和懒惰感到痛惜，他们认为这是帝国衰落的原因。这种繁荣对勤劳美德的侵蚀会出乎意料地迅速发生。德国人仍然是一个有能力和有效率的民族，但他们的工作却不像 1945 年战败后重建国家时那样努力。在两代人的时间里，他们已经从长时间工作，几乎是赤手空拳，在严重贫困的条件下，变成了短时间工作，获得地球上最高的薪酬和最昂贵的福利。</p>

He had worked to establish his own business, and to make enough money to retire by the age of forty. He married a young and attractive woman, he bought a beautiful home, he had a young family, his business was highly successful, and by the age of forty he had indeed been able to sell out and retire, a rich and independent man with nothing apparently to worry about. At first he enjoyed his freedom, was able to do things he had long promised himself. He took his family to Europe. They visited art galleries and so on. Gradually these interests, and his sense of freedom itself, began to pale. He started to look back at the time when he was not free, when he was working all hours at his business and had all the usual business worries, as the happy period of his life. He fell into a depression, which led his wife to bring him to Jung as a patient.

            <!-- <p>For human beings it is the struggle rather than the achievement that matters; we are made for action, and the achievement can prove to be a great disappointment. The ambition, whatever it may be, sets the struggle in motion, but the struggle is more enjoyable than its own result, even when the objective is fully achieved. And, of course, for most people, the objectives can be achieved only partially. Most of us do not have as much money as we would like, and do not live in our dream house. We have to settle for something less.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

The strenuous mood, on the contrary, makes us quite indifferent to present ill, if only the greater ideal be attained. The capacity for the strenuous mood probably lies slumbering in every man but it has more difficulty in some than others in waking up. It needs the wilder passions to arouse it, the big fears, loves and indignation; or else the deeply penetrating appeal of some one of the higher fidelities, like justice, truth, and freedom. Strong relief is a necessity of its vision; and a world where all the mountains are brought down and all the valleys are exalted is no congenial place for its habitation. This is why in a solitary thinker this mood might slumber on forever without waking. His various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value: he can play fast or loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximal stimulating power. Life, to be sure, is even in such a world a genuine ethical symphony; but it is played in the compass of a couple of poor octaves, and the infinite scale of values fails to open up.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

The survival of human societies depends, however, on cultural choices that are based on human intelligence. Culture changes human society as genes change other species. Change can therefore take place much faster in our societies. It does not have to work through many generations as it does when it depends on random genetic mutations. In place of the natural selection in animals, human beings have developed cultural selection, with some cultures, at some stage of human history, developing new technologies that gave them a decisive advantage in wealth creation or mustering power. The cultural edge of new technologies, such as Iron Age man had over Bronze Age man, or electronic man has over mechanical man, are decisive.

The last paragraph of the 1798 “Essay” reads:</p><span class="english"></span> -->

It is not only the interest, but the duty of every individual, to use his utmost efforts to remove evil from himself, and from as large a circle as he can influence; and the more he exercises himself in this duty, the more wisely he directs his efforts, and the more successful these efforts are; the more he will probably improve and exalt his own mind, and the more completely does he appear to fulfil the will of his Creator.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>Perhaps one can illustrate Darwin’s sense of the importance of this argument from his summary of the contents of Chapter 3 of his epoch-making book, <em>On the Origin of Species,</em>first published in 1859. He called this crucial chapter “Struggle for Existence.” The subject headlines are: “Bears on Natural Selection—The term used in a wide sense—Geometrical powers of increase—Rapid increase of naturalized animals and plants—Nature of the checks to increase—Competition universal—Effects of climate—Protection from the number of individuals—Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature—Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species; often severe between species of the same genus—The relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>也许人们可以从达尔文对其划时代著作《物种起源》第三章内容的总结中说明这一论点的重要性，《物种起源》首次出版于 1859 年。他把这一关键章节称为『为生存而斗争』。主题的标题是。『关于自然选择的论述 —— 该术语在广泛的意义上使用 —— 增加的几何力量 —— 归化的动物和植物的快速增加 —— 对增加的制约的性质 —— 竞争的普遍性 —— 气候的影响 —— 来自个体数量的保护 —— 整个自然界所有动物和植物的复杂关系 —— 在同一物种的个体和品种之间的生命斗争最严重；在同一属的物种之间往往很严重

Since 1798, it has been evident that the relative survival of populations depended on societies having sufficient economic and political success to be able to feed themselves, protect themselves from infectious diseases, and protect their populations in war. Since 1859, it has been evident that the whole drama of life, in the human, the animal, or the vegetable kingdom, consists of a continuous struggle for survival, in which those species or cultures that are nearest to each other may be the greatest rivals. This struggle requires a dynamic morality, which actively wards off evil and does not merely respond to it when it happens.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>自 1776 年以来，很明显，优化国家财富的最佳方式是允许个人在自由竞争的条件下优化自己的资本回报。自 1798 年以来，显而易见的是，人口的相对生存取决于社会是否有足够的经济和政治成就，以便能够养活自己，保护自己不受传染病影响，并在战争中保护其人口。自 1859 年以来，显而易见的是，在人类、动物或植物王国中，整个生命的戏剧由一场持续的生存斗争组成，在这场斗争中，那些彼此距离最近的物种或文化可能是最大的对手。这种斗争需要一种动态的道德，这种道德积极地抵御邪恶，而不仅仅是在邪恶发生时做出反应。</p>

            <!-- <p>These ideas have been so powerful that it has been impossible for anyone to think about the nature of humanity, or the problems of morality, since the time in which they were developed, without responding to them. Karl Marx believed in the struggle for survival just as much as Charles Darwin, but he believed it was a war between social classes, themselves formed by economic forces. Adolf Hitler believed in the struggle for survival, and saw his own political career almost exclusively in those terms. But he believed that the struggle was one between different races. Marx, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Hitler can all be called social Darwinists, in that they saw the struggle for survival, “Mein Kampf” as Hitler called it, as the central political issue. The Marxists saw social classes as though they were separate species; the Nazis saw races in the same light.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这些思想是如此强大，以至于自它们被提出的时候起，任何人在思考人类的本质或道德问题时，都不可能不对它们做出反应。卡尔·马克思和查尔斯·达尔文一样相信生存的斗争，但他认为这是一场社会阶级之间的战争，而这些阶级本身就是由经济力量形成的。阿道夫·希特勒相信生存斗争，并几乎完全从这些方面看待自己的政治生涯。但他认为，这场斗争是不同种族之间的斗争。马克思、列宁、斯大林、毛泽东和希特勒都可以被称为社会达尔文主义者，因为他们把生存斗争，即希特勒所说的『我的奋斗』，视为核心政治问题。马克思主义者把社会阶层看成是独立的物种；纳粹分子也以同样的眼光看待种族。</p>

            <!-- <p>This, however, makes not a dynamic morality, such as Malthus envisaged, but a dynamic immorality. Both Marxism and Nazism wished to solve the same problem, the problem of the struggle for survival, but by destroying competition. They invaded foreign territories, they promoted conflict between different classes who competed for social power, or different races who were seen either as economic exploiters (the normal charge made against Jews by anti-Semites) or as a dangerous underclass (the fear held of blacks by their white enemies). The Second World War was an attempt by Adolf Hitler, which failed, to secure an advantage in survival terms of the German people, by destroying potential competition, particularly Slavs and Jews. By an interesting paradox, defeat in war proved more advantageous to Germany than the victory of the Nazis could ever have been.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，这并不是一种动态的道德，如马尔萨斯所设想的，而是一种动态的不道德。马克思主义和纳粹主义都希望解决同一个问题，即为生存而斗争的问题，但却是通过破坏竞争。他们入侵外国领土国家，他们促进不同阶级之间的冲突，这些阶级争夺社会权力，或不同种族被视为经济剥削者（反犹太主义者对犹太人的正常指控）或危险的下层社会（白人敌人对黑人的恐惧）。第二次世界大战是阿道夫·希特勒通过摧毁潜在的竞争者，特别是斯拉夫人和犹太人，来确保德国人民的生存优势，但这一尝试失败了。一个有趣的悖论是，战争的失败被证明为比纳粹的胜利对德国更有利。</p>

            <!-- <p>The alternative to destructive “interference” competition is collaborative competition, and collaborative competition is the central idea of Adam Smith, and also of Malthus and of William James. The archetype of destructive competition is the conqueror. He destroys his competitors in order to seize their assets, which may include taking over their countries and may involve the enslavement of their peoples. The archetype of collaborative competition is the merchant. It is in the interest of the merchant that the customer should be satisfied with the transaction, because only a satisfied customer comes back for more trade. It is also in the interest of the merchant that the customer should be prosperous, because a prosperous customer has the money to go on buying. Conquest implies the destruction of the other party; commerce implies the satisfaction of the other party. As modern technology has made conquest an extraordinarily dangerous policy, commerce has become the only rational approach to the problems of survival.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>破坏性的『干扰』竞争的替代品是协作性竞争，而协作性竞争是亚当·斯密的核心思想，也是马尔萨斯和威廉·詹姆斯的思想。破坏性竞争的典型是征服者。他破坏他的竞争对手，以夺取他们的资产，这可能包括接管他们的国家，可能涉及奴役他们的人民。合作性竞争的典型是商人。客户对交易感到满意符合商人的利益，因为只有满意的客户才会回来做更多的交易。客户的繁荣也符合商人的利益，因为一个繁荣的客户有足够的钱来继续购买。征服意味着摧毁对方；商业则意味着满足对方。由于现代技术已使征服成为一种异常危险的政策，商业已成为解决生存问题的唯一理性方法。</p>

            <!-- <p>This interdependence is strengthened by another central idea of Adam Smith—not new with him—which is the specialization of function. The <em>Wealth of Nations</em>starts with a celebrated passage in which Adam Smith observes that “the greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity and judgement with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.” He points out that “the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands.” The more complete the specialization of function, the more efficient the manufacture is likely to be, but obviously such an economy is highly interdependent. If it is to be successful, it has to be collaborative.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种相互依存关系因亚当·斯密的另一个中心思想而得到加强 —— 这对他来说并不陌生 —— 这就是功能的专业化。在《国富论》中，亚当·斯密指出，『劳动生产力的最大提高，以及在任何地方指导或应用劳动的技能、灵巧和判断力的大部分，似乎都是劳动分工的结果』。他指出，『以这种方式，制作大头针的重要业务被划分为大约 18 项不同的操作，在一些工厂中，这些操作都由不同的人完成。』 职能的专业化程度越高，制造业的效率就越高，但显然这种经济是高度相互依赖的。如果它要成功，它必须是协作性的。</p>

            <!-- <p>A successful social morality must therefore have certain characteristics. It must be strong—a weak morality will be vulnerable and ineffective. It must contribute to the struggle for survival, but in ways that are collaborative rather than murderous. Hitler had a strong morality of survival, but its destructive quality nearly destroyed his own society. It must be dynamic, to match the dynamic changes of modern technology, and indeed of all modern social systems. It must be economically efficient. The mixture of egalitarian and authoritarian ideas in the Leninist system simply did not work. Yet these are not all the characteristics that such a social morality might be expected to possess. It has a broader purpose of making the society a good one to live in, and of binding people together. Also, moralities have to adapt and survive; a brittle morality may be acceptable in our generation only to be rejected in the next. A traditional social morality may be too inflexible to adapt to successive changes in social structure. On the other hand a purely relativist system is not a morality at all; it gives no clear signals on how to behave.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>因此，一个成功的社会道德必须具备某些特征。它必须是强大的 —— 弱小的道德将是脆弱和无效的。它必须为生存斗争做出贡献，但其方式是协作性的，而不是谋杀性的。希特勒有一个强大的生存道德，但其破坏性的品质几乎摧毁了他自己的社会。它必须是动态的，以配合现代技术，乃至所有现代社会系统的动态变化。它必须在经济上有效。列宁主义体系中平等主义和专制主义思想的混合体根本无法发挥作用。然而，这些并不是这种社会道德可能被期望拥有的所有特征。它有一个更广泛的目的，即让社会成为一个良好的生活环境，并将人们联系在一起。此外，道德必须适应和生存；一个脆弱的道德可能在我们这一代被接受，但在下一代却被拒绝。传统的社会道德可能太不灵活，无法适应社会结构的连续变化。另一方面，一个纯粹的相对主义系统根本就不是一种道德；它没有给出关于如何行为的明确信号。</p>

            <!-- <p>We can first of all put all social morality inside a context. A strong community, even a virtual community, depends upon the morality being widely accepted. The most successful periods in the history of societies tend to be those in which the collective morality is fully shared. Such a morality not only performs specific functions such as reducing crime, and helping to support family and social structures, but gives citizens a sense of purpose and direction. Such a consensus on morality historically seems to depend on there being a dominant religion, whether that is a state religion of the early Roman Empire; the religion of the Jews, which has been the thread of survival for a dispersed people; the Islamic religion with its social rules; the Catholicism of the Middle Ages; or the Protestantism of early New England. The three ideas of a people, a morality, and a religion depend upon one another, and each tends to reinforce the others.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>首先，我们可以把所有的社会道德放在一个背景中。一个强大的社区，甚至是一个虚拟社区，取决于道德是否被广泛接受。社会历史上最成功的时期往往是那些集体道德得到充分认同的时期。这样的道德不仅发挥了具体的功能，如减少犯罪，帮助支持家庭和社会结构，而且给公民带来目的和方向感。在历史上，这样的道德共识似乎取决于是否有一个占主导地位的宗教，无论是早期罗马帝国的国教；犹太人的宗教，它一直是分散的民族的生存线；伊斯兰教及其社会规则；中世纪的天主教；或早期新英格兰的新教。一个民族、一种道德和一种宗教这三种观念相互依存，而且每一种观念都倾向于加强其他观念。</p>

            <!-- <p>In such a moral society, the individual citizen is able to work toward personal objectives inside a framework of social support. Admittedly the moral laws may be somewhat arbitrary, or at least may appear arbitrary to outsiders. The Orthodox Jew loses the freedom to eat pork or shellfish, or to work on the Sabbath. The loyal Catholic may lose the freedom to use artificial contraceptives, let alone to have an abortion. The Moslem may lose the freedom to drink alcohol. The pious Confucian may have the inconveniently long period of mourning for his reverend father—even Confucius himself warned that mourning rituals could be exaggerated. Yet the adherent to each of these systems of belief regards these observations as a small price to pay for a shared and coherent sense of world order, in which the individual has a settled place. An Orthodox Jew could well argue that the observance of the Sabbath is a small price to pay for the benefits of the Law or the strength of the Jewish family. A shared morality in a tolerant society was the ideal of John Locke and of early philosophers of liberty. They did not at all believe that a society, of any kind, can be maintained without rules, but they thought that the rules ought to be subject to the best of reason, and that people should be coerced to accept only the essential rules. They did recognize that coercion was inevitable in social morality, particularly in the protection of life or of property, because they considered that no society can survive if there is no security. They applied an almost absolute tolerance to variations in personal choices that did not affect the welfare of others. The Confucian, mourning his father for forty days, could live next door to the Jew, honoring the Sabbath, without either disturbing the other, or wanting to coerce him into following his own religious practices.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在这样一个道德社会中，公民个人能够在社会支持的框架内努力实现个人目标。诚然，道德法律可能有些武断，或者至少在外人看来是武断的。正统的犹太人失去了吃猪肉或贝类的自由，或在安息日工作的自由。忠诚的天主教徒可能会失去使用人工避孕药的自由，更不用说堕胎了。伊斯兰教徒可能会失去饮酒的自由。虔诚的儒家可能要为他尊敬的父亲服丧很长一段时间，这很不方便 —— 甚至孔子自己也警告说，服丧仪式可能被夸大了。然而，这些信仰体系中的每一个的信徒都认为这些观察是为一个共同的、一致的世界秩序感而付出的小代价，在这个世界上，个人有一个安定的位置。一个正统的犹太人完全可以说，遵守安息日是为法律的好处或犹太家庭的力量所付出的小代价。一个宽容的社会中的共同道德是约翰·洛克和早期自由主义哲学家的理想。他们根本不相信任何类型的社会可以在没有规则的情况下维持，但他们认为，这些规则应该受到最佳理性的制约，人们应该被强迫只接受基本的规则。他们确实承认，在社会道德中，特别是在保护生命或财产方面，强制是不可避免的，因为他们认为，如果没有安全，任何社会都无法生存。他们对不影响他人福利的个人选择的变化采用了几乎绝对的宽容。儒家为父亲守丧四十天，可以住在犹太人的隔壁，遵守安息日，而不会打扰对方，也不会想胁迫他遵循自己的宗教习俗。</p>

            <!-- <p>From this combined doctrine of social morality in essential matters and tolerance in personal decisions, one actually gets a core moral standard that has to be imposed on all citizens and a voluntary ethic that citizens accept as individuals or as members of subgroups in society. When a Benedictine monk takes vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, he does so as a member of such a subgroup. He does not call on all Catholics, let alone on all his fellow citizens, to take the same vows, or to observe the same rules. He will be obedient to the orders of his abbot, but he does not expect anyone outside his abbey to pay any attention to them. The adherence to these optional parts of social morality does not need to be universal, but the core morality does have to be shared, and people who will not accept the core morality damage society as well as themselves. In the extreme example, a society overrun with robbers who do not hesitate to murder, as large parts of Europe were after the fall of the Roman Empire, offers nobody a satisfactory life, not even the robbers themselves; they are always particularly threatened by other murderers. This is equally true of some inner-city areas of the United States today. Anarchy is not the ideal society, because without the enforcement of law there is no human security.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>从这种在基本事务中的社会道德和个人决定中的宽容相结合的学说中，人们实际上得到了一个必须强加给所有公民的核心道德标准，以及一个公民作为个人或社会中的子群体成员所接受的自愿道德。当本笃会的修士发下贫穷、贞洁和服从的誓言时，他是作为这样一个亚群体的成员。他并不要求所有的天主教徒，更不要求他的所有同胞都发同样的誓言，或遵守同样的规则。他将服从他的修道院院长的命令，但他并不期望他的修道院以外的人对这些命令有任何关注。对社会道德的这些可有可无的部分的遵守不需要是普遍的，但核心道德确实必须被分享，不愿意接受核心道德的人既损害社会也损害自己。在极端的例子中，一个充斥着毫不犹豫地杀人的强盗的社会，就像罗马帝国灭亡后欧洲的大部分地区一样，没有人能够提供满意的生活，甚至强盗自己也不能；他们总是特别受到其他杀人犯的威胁。这在今天美国的一些内城地区同样如此。无政府状态不是理想的社会，因为没有法律的执行，就没有人类的安全。</p>

            <!-- <p>When one looks at the forces that are hostile to the morality of society, one needs to consider this core morality, which is broadly similar in most modern religious belief systems. Two, at least, of the Ten Commandments of the Old Testament, for Christians, or the Torah, for Jews, can be regarded as universal for anything one could recognize as a religion: “Thou shalt not kill” and “Thou shalt not steal.” One can even go beyond that. Almost all serious agnostics would regard both murder and theft—the ultimate threat to life and the ultimate threat to property—as forbidden, and would accept that society has the right to punish people who kill or rob. They might disagree about the appropriate punishment for a particular crime, but not about the right of society to punish as such.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当人们审视那些敌视社会道德的力量时，需要考虑这种核心道德，它在大多数现代宗教信仰体系中大致相似。在基督教徒的《旧约》或犹太人的《托拉》的十条戒律中，至少有两条可以被视为对任何可以被视为宗教的东西的普遍性。『不可杀人』和『不可偷盗』。人们甚至可以超越这一点。几乎所有严肃的不可知论者都会认为谋杀和偷窃 —— 对生命的最终威胁和对财产的最终威胁 —— 是被禁止的，并且会接受社会有权惩罚杀人或抢劫的人。他们可能对某一特定罪行的适当惩罚有异议，但对社会惩罚的权利没有异议。</p>

            <!-- <p>The original phrase of John Locke has it precisely. Everyone has a right to “life, liberty and estate.” In 1776 Thomas Jefferson added another of John Locke’s phrases, “the pursuit of happiness.” That makes a very fine phrase, and a very fine aspiration, but “life, liberty and estate” is more down to earth than “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Society depends absolutely on the right to life and the right to property. In practice history shows that these rights can be protected only when there is liberty. If the state is all-powerful, then the state becomes the great enemy of life, as in wars of aggression, and of individual property, by taking an inordinate share of the national wealth for its own often undesirable and always wasteful purposes.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>约翰·洛克的原话有确切的说法。每个人都有『生命、自由和财产』的权利。1776 年，托马斯·杰斐逊添加了约翰·洛克的另一个短语，『追求幸福』。这是一个非常好的短语，也是一个非常好的愿望，但『生命、自由和财产』比『生命、自由和对幸福的追求』更贴近实际。社会绝对依赖于生命权和财产权。在实践中，历史表明，只有在有自由的情况下，这些权利才能得到保护。如果国家是全能的，那么国家就会成为生命的大敌，比如在侵略战争中，以及个人财产的大敌，因为它为了自己经常不受欢迎的、总是浪费的目的而过多地占有国家财富。</p>

            <!-- <p>The core morality is, however, under attack in the most advanced nations, partly by the very forces of modernity that give these nations their technical edge. The United States is the world’s leading technological power. Many people, including most Americans, would have regarded the United States as a moral example to the rest of the world at any time up to the early 1960s. Now that view is seldom expressed, even by Americans who are proud of their country. One could not listen, as the world did, to the O.J. Simpson trial and regard the United States as the simple virtuous Republic it began by being.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>然而，核心道德在最先进的国家受到攻击，部分原因是赋予这些国家技术优势的现代性力量。美国是世界上领先的技术大国。许多人，包括大多数美国人，在二十世纪 60 年代初之前的任何时候，都会把美国视为世界其他国家的道德榜样。现在，这种观点很少被表达出来，即使是那些为自己国家感到自豪的美国人也不例外。人们不可能像全世界那样，听了 O.J.辛普森的审判，而把美国看作是它最初的那个简单的美德共和国。</p>

            <!-- <p>If one looks back at the labels of the old America, they reflected the needs of a frontier society, which colored the attitudes of its citizens even in the big cities. Frontiers are democratic places. People feel themselves to be equal, and the early Americans threw off the class hierarchies of Europe. Even indentured laborers, sent over from England as prisoners, established themselves as independent tradesmen, farmers, or free laborers once their indenture period was over. Wages were higher than in Europe, and the cost of essentials was low, though imported manufactures were expensive. On the frontier itself people depended very much on one another, but the living, if hard, was a good one by European standards. Immigrants might start as low wage earners in the slums of Boston and New York, but they usually escaped from the slums quite soon, and generation after generation found prosperity. After the Civil War, the blacks saw themselves as though they were another immigrant group, and many of them shared these American values and objectives. From these the black middle class developed.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>如果我们回顾一下旧美国的标签，它们反映了一个边疆社会的需求，即使在大城市，它也会影响公民的态度。边疆是民主的地方。人们觉得自己是平等的，早期的美国人抛开了欧洲的阶级等级制度。即使是作为囚犯从英国送来的契约劳工，一旦契约期结束，他们也会成为独立的商人、农民或自由劳工。工资比欧洲高，必需品的成本也很低，尽管进口产品很贵。在边境地区，人们相互依赖，但生活虽然艰苦，但按照欧洲的标准，还是很不错的。移民可能开始时是在波士顿和纽约的贫民窟中赚取低工资，但他们通常很快就摆脱了贫民窟，而且一代又一代地找到了繁荣。内战结束后，黑人把自己看作是另一个移民群体，他们中的许多人都认同这些美国的价值观和目标。黑人中产阶级就是从这些方面发展起来的。</p>

            <!-- <p>This aspiration, strengthened by the actual experience of the frontier, and by the influence of the churches, both Protestant and Catholic, framed the patriotism of Americans. They believed that they lived in God’s own country, a notion uniquely guided by democratic ideals and Christian faith, the first and most successful of the world’s democracies. The picture is familiar enough; it is personified in the image we all, or almost all, have of Abraham Lincoln, though one can still find some Americans in the South who see Lincoln as the man who unleashed the horrors of the first modern war to prevent free states from leaving a Union they no longer trusted.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这种愿望在边疆的实际经验以及新教和天主教教会的影响下得到了加强，构成了美国人的爱国主义。他们相信，他们生活在上帝自己的国家，这是一个由民主理想和基督教信仰独特引导的概念，是世界上第一个也是最成功的民主国家。这幅画面已经很熟悉了；它在我们所有人或几乎所有人对亚伯拉罕·林肯的印象中得到了体现，尽管人们仍然可以在南方找到一些美国人，他们认为林肯是发动第一次现代战争的恐怖的人，以防止自由州离开他们不再信任的联邦。</p>

            <!-- <p>Nevertheless, the image of Lincoln, craggy, simple, honest, and eloquent, is still the supreme American image, and it is essentially a moral one. Many Americans still feel the vivid original contrast between the democratic energy of the new country and the tired hierarchies of Europe. This ideal of an essentially dynamic meritocracy is hard for the foreigner to recognize in present-day Los Angeles, New York, Houston, or Washington, even though its traces, and something more than traces, can still be found in the great suburban belts or in the rural areas. The American Puritan ethic, with all its historic importance, survives best north of the snowline, but the entrepreneurial dynamism is more widespread.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管如此，林肯的形象，粗犷、朴实、诚实、雄辩，仍然是美国的最高形象，而且基本上是一个道德形象。许多美国人仍然感受到新国家的民主活力和欧洲疲惫的等级制度之间生动的原始对比。在今天的洛杉矶、纽约、休斯顿或华盛顿，外国人很难认识到这种本质上充满活力的功利主义的理想，尽管在大的郊区地带或农村地区仍然可以找到它的痕迹，而且不止是痕迹。美国的清教徒伦理，连同其所有的历史重要性，在雪线以北地区生存得最好，但企业家的活力更为广泛。</p>

            <!-- <p>Americans would point to the decay of the big cities, which have become breeding grounds for crime, especially the narco-business, as the worst symptom of the decline of a communal sense of morality. Most Americans also recognize that there is a clash of several different moral cultures, all competing in their claims and their authority. The “politically correct” culture rejects many, but not all, of the moral principles that upheld the old culture. It aggressively emphasizes the role and the rights of groups who are seen as having been historically exploited by a dominant white male culture, and rejects that culture, despite its being the founding culture of the United States.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>美国人会指出大城市的衰败，它们已经成为犯罪，特别是毒品交易的温床，是社区道德感衰退的最严重症状。大多数美国人也认识到，存在着几种不同的道德文化的冲突，它们都在争夺自己的主张和权威。『政治上正确』的文化拒绝了许多，但不是全部，支撑旧文化的道德原则。它积极地强调那些被视为在历史上被占主导地位的白人男性文化所剥削的群体的作用和权利，并拒绝这种文化，尽管它是美国的创始文化。</p>

            <!-- <p>The dominant male culture of the first half of the twentieth century centered on the survival of the nuclear family. This historically gave the husband-father at least a nominal dominance in the home, though in practice the home was often run by the wife-mother with the often meek acceptance of the nominal master. It gave the male boss a real dominance in the workplace, a dominance that the feminist movement has so far challenged but not reversed. The interest of the family, and historic Christian teaching, outlawed abortion. The old morality thought abortion was unlawful killing, was never allowable, and the adherents of the traditional morality still think that. Adherents of the new morality think the opposite. In <em>Roe</em>v. <em>Wade</em>the Supreme Court based the constitutional right to abortion, which had hitherto been regarded as a question for the individual states, on the doctrine of a right to privacy, itself remote from any language actually to be found in the Constitution or its amendments.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>二十世纪上半叶的男性主导文化以核心家庭的生存为中心。这在历史上至少给了丈夫·父亲在家庭中的名义上的支配地位，尽管在实践中，家庭往往由妻子·母亲管理，而名义上的主人往往温顺地接受。它使男性老板在工作场所拥有真正的支配地位，这种支配地位至今受到女权运动的挑战，但没有被扭转。家庭的利益和历史上的基督教教义将堕胎定为非法。旧的道德观认为堕胎是非法的杀戮，是绝不允许的，传统道德观的信徒仍然这样认为。新道德观的拥护者则持相反的看法。在罗诉韦德案中，最高法院将迄今为止被视为各州问题的堕胎的宪法权利建立在隐私权的理论上，而这一理论本身与宪法或其修正案中实际存在的任何语言相去甚远。</p>

            <blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：罗诉韦德案（<em>Roe v. Wade</em>），又译为露对威德案，是美国联邦最高法院于1973年对于妇女堕胎权以及隐私权的重要案例，对于妇女堕胎的问题，美国联邦最高法院承认妇女的堕胎权，受到宪法隐私权的保护。此外最高法院对堕胎权的限制应采取严格审查标准，并提出『三阶段标准』。</blockquote>

            <!-- <p>A woman’s privacy was held to include the right to have or not to have children, whatever the consequences to the embryo might be. The Supreme Court did not regard the embryo as enjoying any constitutional rights—embryos being the same extraconstitutional entities in the late twentieth century that slaves had been in the first half of the nineteenth. “Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” did not apply to slaves, and the language of the Declaration of Independence was not applied to embryos by the justices in <em>Roe</em>v. <em>Wade.</em></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>妇女的隐私被认为包括拥有或不拥有孩子的权利，无论对胚胎可能产生什么后果。最高法院不认为胚胎享有任何宪法权利 —— 在二十世纪末，胚胎与十九世纪上半叶的奴隶一样是宪法外的实体。并不适用于奴隶，《独立宣言》的语言也没有在罗诉韦德案中被适用于胚胎。</p>

            <!-- <p>The abortion debate is the extreme example of the conflict between the old and new morality, though there are equally remarkable conflicts in other areas where the old social organization with its morality has been challenged by the new. Traditional Christian morality, in Protestant and Catholic churches alike, laid great emphasis on sexual roles: No heterosexual intercourse outside or before marriage. No genital homosexual relationships. Lesbianism was less emphasized, because society hardly recognized its existence. When Queen Victoria was first told of it, she stoutly refused to believe that such things happened between women. Political correctness is the morality of supposedly oppressed groups. The homosexuals claimed an equal validity for their lifestyle, and challenged the traditional opposition to their sexual conduct. “Homophobia” was regarded as being itself an outrageous form of prejudice, like racial discrimination. To be critical of gays is regarded by the new morality as being as unacceptable as being critical of blacks, Jews, or women.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>堕胎辩论是新旧道德冲突的极端例子，尽管在其他领域也有同样显著的冲突，旧的社会组织及其道德受到了新的挑战。传统的基督教道德，在新教和天主教会中，都非常强调性角色。没有婚外或婚前的异性性交。没有生殖器的同性恋关系。女同性恋没有被强调，因为社会几乎不承认它的存在。当维多利亚女王第一次被告知此事时，她坚决拒绝相信这种事情发生在妇女之间。政治正确是所谓的受压迫群体的道德。同性恋者声称他们的生活方式具有平等的有效性，并挑战传统上对他们性行为的反对。『恐同症』被认为本身就是一种令人发指的偏见，就像种族歧视一样。对同性恋的批评被新的道德观视为与对黑人、犹太人或妇女的批评一样不可接受。</p>

            <!-- <p>At the same time other sexual taboos were being eroded or abolished. In the 1960s there was a new wave of free love, partly based on the apparent security of the female contraceptive pill, but also promoted by mood-changing drugs and pop music. It led to an increasing amount of nonmarital cohabitation. By the 1990s it was thought absolutely normal in Britain, a rather more old-fashioned society than most of the United States, for Prince Edward to sleep with his girlfriend at Buckingham Palace, in the same stable but unmarried intimacy that students were sleeping with each other in their 1960s lodgings. Few people thought it odd that Queen Elizabeth II, the head of the Church of England, condoned her youngest son’s conduct, her three elder children’s marriages having already broken down. Those few who complained were regarded as hopelessly out of date and priggish. Yet there were still many people who regarded the old morality as preferable, even if they did not practice it themselves, or seriously expect their children to do so, beyond a fairly early age.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>与此同时，其他的性禁忌也被侵蚀或废除了。二十世纪 60 年代，出现了新的自由恋爱浪潮，部分原因是基于女性避孕药的明显安全性，但也有改变情绪的药物和流行音乐的推动。这导致了越来越多的非婚同居现象。到了二十世纪 90 年代，在英国这个比美国大多数国家更为守旧的社会，人们认为爱德华王子在白金汉宫与他的女朋友睡觉是绝对正常的，就像学生们在 1960 年代的宿舍里互相睡觉一样，是一种稳定但未婚的亲密关系。很少有人认为英国女王伊丽莎白二世作为英国教会的领袖，纵容她最小的儿子的行为是奇怪的，她的三个大孩子的婚姻已经破裂了。那些抱怨的人被认为是无可救药的落伍者和假正经。然而，仍有许多人认为旧的道德观是可取的，即使他们自己不实践，或认真地期望他们的孩子在相当早的年龄后也能这样做。</p>

            <!-- <p>The politically correct movement has had its own puritanical side. Because it sprang from the perceived interests of women, seen as the largest of the oppressed groups, it had a certain hostility to male sexuality, both in aggressive and in what would previously have been regarded as harmless forms. Some women took the view that all men were by nature rapists, and the natural horror at rape was exaggerated into a general denunciation of the male gender. Others concentrated on sexual harassment, a real grievance—many men have very crude sexual manners—which became ludicrous in some trivial cases. Sexual harassment was even alleged in mere looks, without any word being uttered, let alone physical contact. As a result the new morality could be very censorious. White people could be accused of racial prejudices, not because they were prejudiced but because they were white. Men could be accused of sexual harassment because their expressions showed that they found a woman attractive, something that in an earlier generation had been regarded as a compliment rather than an insult.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>政治正确运动也有其清教徒的一面。因为它源于被视为最大的受压迫群体的妇女利益，所以它对男性的性行为有一定的敌意，无论是积极的还是以前被认为是无害的形式。一些妇女认为，所有男人都是天生的强奸犯，对强奸的自然恐惧被夸大为对男性的普遍谴责。另一些人则专注于性骚扰，这是一种真正的不满 —— 许多男人都有非常粗鲁的性行为 —— 这在一些琐碎的案件中变得很可笑。性骚扰甚至被指责为仅仅是眼神，没有任何言语，更不用说身体接触。因此，新的道德观可能是非常审查性的。白人可能被指控有种族偏见，不是因为他们有偏见，而是因为他们是白人。男人可以被指控为性骚扰，因为他们的表情显示他们发现一个女人很有吸引力，这在上一代被认为是一种恭维而不是一种侮辱。</p>

            <!-- <p>The politically correct and the fundamentalist Christian groups are bitterly critical of each other, yet in the modern world they look rather alike. They both assume the authority of a particular moral doctrine as though it were universal, even though their moral doctrines are different. Both indeed can be criticized for the same defect, for an exaggerated and overconfident moralism, lacking in depth, in historic sense, or in tolerance. Both are attacked for their supposed resemblance to seventeenth-century Puritanism, to the self-confident moralists like Oliver Cromwell in England—he nearly emigrated to New England—or the Salem witch hunters. Neither the women’s movement, in its more dogmatic form, nor the conservative preachers of the Bible belt can be accused of any lack of morality, but of its overdevelopment and rigidity. The heart of these moralities sometimes seems to have turned to stone. This sort of hardening of the moral arteries is as damaging to the consensual morality of society as the “anything goes” anarchy against which it protests.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>政治正确派和基督教原教旨主义团体互相批判，然而在现代世界中，他们看起来相当相似。他们都把某一特定道德教义的权威性当作是普遍的，尽管他们的道德教义是不同的。两者确实可以因为同样的缺陷而受到批评，因为它们都是夸张和过于自信的道德主义，缺乏深度，缺乏历史感，也缺乏宽容。两者都被抨击为与十七世纪的清教主义相似，与英国的奥利弗·克伦威尔（<em>Oliver Cromwell</em>）这样自信的道德家相似，或者与塞勒姆的猎巫者相似。无论是更教条化的妇女运动，还是圣经地带的保守传教士，都不能被指责为缺乏道德，而是指责其过度发展和僵化。这些道德观的核心有时似乎变成了石头。这种道德动脉的硬化对社会的共识道德的损害，与它所抗议的『什么都可以』的无政府状态一样。</p>

            <!-- <p>It is a distortion of moral forces, a coarsening into self-righteousness. Pharisaism, the conviction that one is uniquely virtuous, is as old as humankind, and was particularly offensive to Jesus Christ. The erosion of morality, the belief that ethical choices are purely a matter of private preference, as much a matter for the individual as the choice of clothes, is a more recent phenomenon. This belief reflects the absence of any shared morality at all. It takes to a quite new stage the classical doctrine of liberty, and turns “the pursuit of happiness” from what John Locke originally meant by the phrase, and Jefferson understood by it in 1776, into a hedonism that is reckless of consequences.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这是对道德力量的扭曲，是对自以为是的粗暴化。法利赛主义，即相信自己是独一无二的美德，与人类一样古老，而且对耶稣基督特别反感。对道德的侵蚀，认为道德选择纯粹是个人偏好的问题，就像选择衣服一样是个人的事，是最近的现象。这种信念反映了根本不存在任何共同的道德。它把古典的自由学说带到了一个相当新的阶段，并把『追求幸福』从约翰·洛克最初对这句话的意思，以及杰斐逊在 1776 年对它的理解，变成了一种不计后果的享乐主义。</p>

            <!-- <p>The phrase “the pursuit of happiness” is taken from John Locke’s <em>Essay on Human Understanding</em> (1691): “the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful pursuit of true and solid happiness, so the care of ourselves that we mistake not imaginary for real happiness, is the necessary foundation of our liberty.” He does go on to say that “everyone does not place his happiness in the same thing.… the mind has a different relish as well as the palate.… Men may choose different things, yet all choose right, supposing them only like a company of poor insects, whereof some are bees, delighted with flowers and their sweetness, others beetles delighted with other kinds of viands.” Yet he goes on to argue that to prefer vice to virtue is “manifestly a wrong judgement.” He puts particular weight on the religious argument, but considers also that “wicked men have the worse part here.” He believes that “morality, established upon its true foundations, cannot but determine the choice in anyone who will consider.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>『追求幸福』一语出自约翰·洛克的《人类理解论》（<em>Essay on Human Understanding, 1691</em>）。『智力性质的最高完善在于谨慎地追求真正的和坚实的幸福，因此，对自己的关心，使我们不把想象的幸福误认为是真正的幸福，是我们自由的必要基础』。他接着说，『每个人都不把他的幸福放在同一件事上，…… 头脑和味觉都不同，…… 人们可能选择不同的东西，但都选择正确的，假设他们只是像一群可怜的昆虫，其中一些是蜜蜂，喜欢花和花的甜味，另一些是甲虫，喜欢其他种类的食物。』然而，他继续争辩说，『宁要恶习不要美德，显然是一种错误的判断』。他特别看重宗教论点，但也认为『恶人在这里有更坏的部分』。他认为，『建立在真实基础上的道德，不能不决定任何愿意考虑的人的选择』。</p>

            <!-- <p>The Lockean doctrine of liberty undoubtedly gives a wider range to human preferences than more authoritarian moral systems that seek to treat all people alike, and impose uniformity of conduct. Yet soon the classic doctrine of liberty recognizes the need for collective moral imperatives, including respect for other people in society, particularly their lives and the peaceful ownership of their possessions under the law. A general erosion of the collective morality threatens liberty, both directly, in that it introduces an element of anarchy, and indirectly, by encouraging the most authoritarian forces of society. We can see the history of public morality as a cycle between disorder and authoritarianism; the modern authoritarian moralities, both feminism and fundamentalism, have emerged as a cyclical response to the hedonism of the 1960s.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>洛克的自由学说无疑给人类的偏好提供了一个更广泛的范围，而不是像更多的专制道德体系那样寻求对所有的人一视同仁，并强加统一的行为。然而，经典的自由学说很快就认识到了集体道德要求的必要性，包括尊重社会中的其他人，尤其是他们的生命和法律规定的对其财产的和平所有权。集体道德的普遍侵蚀威胁着自由，这既是直接的，因为它引入了无政府状态的因素，也是间接的，因为它鼓励了社会中最独裁的力量。我们可以把公共道德的历史看作是无序与专制之间的循环；现代的专制道德，包括女权主义和原教旨主义，都是作为对
                1960 年代享乐主义的循环反应而出现的。

It will be shaped by two main forces, the shift of technology that is opening up the economies of Asia and the new global electronic communications that are making the citizen progressively less dependent on his or her local government. The new technology will replace, or has already replaced, many of the middle human skills—the production line worker, the office clerk, now increasingly the middle manager. But it has rewarded the rarer skills, creating an international cognitive elite of highly skilled people for whom the new communications open up the widest possible market for their skills. Like most elites, the cognitive elite tend to be a bit above themselves, are rather arrogant, and think they can set their own standards.

            <!-- <p>During the first half of the next century there will be a massive transfer of wealth from the Old West to the New East. Political failures—and China is still a politically backward country—may delay this transfer of wealth and strategic power, but are most unlikely to prevent it. They cannot reverse it.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>This process of the shift in wealth would in any case put the greatest possible pressure on the white-dominated countries of the Northern Hemisphere, on Europe and North America. At present about 750 million people, belong to the advanced countries of this area; until very recently Japan was the only Asian, nonwhite country to have reached the Euro-American standard of living, though there were ethnically European populations in New Zealand, in Australia, and in the white population of southern Africa. Even in 1990, the total population of the advanced industrial countries was only about 15 percent of the world population of 5 billion. The shape of the distribution of the world’s wealth was 15 percent rich, 85 percent poor, very like the income distribution in advanced industrial societies a hundred years ago. By 2050, in an accelerating process, the expectation is that the advanced economies will include about 3 billion people out of a world population that may have risen to 7 billion, or a wealth distribution of 40 percent rich, 60 percent poor. By the end of the century these figures could well be reversed, and the distribution could be 60 percent rich and 40 percent poor, with poverty particularly concentrated in Africa. The shift between nations will be toward a greater equality of wealth, but inside nations it will probably be toward greater inequality. The efficient users of talent and capital will have a decisive advantage over those with moderate skills or little capital. This wealth will be highly mobile. The poor in the advanced world will not be able to tax the rich on the twentieth-century scale; those countries that try to do so will fall back in an intensely competitive race.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这个财富转移的过程在任何情况下都会给北半球以白人为主的国家、欧洲和北美带来最大的压力。目前约有 7.5 亿人，属于这一地区的先进国家；直到最近，日本是唯一达到欧美生活标准的亚洲非白人国家，尽管在新西兰、澳大利亚和南部非洲的白人人口中也有欧洲族裔人口。即使在 1990 年，先进工业国家的总人口也只占世界 50 亿人口的 15% 左右。世界财富分配的形状是 15% 的富人，85% 的穷人，非常像 100 年前先进工业社会的收入分配。到 2050 年，在一个加速的过程中，预计先进的经济体将包括约
                30 亿人，而世界人口可能已经上升到 70 亿，或财富分配为 40% 的富人，60% 的穷人。到本世纪末，这些数字很可能被颠覆，财富分配可能是 60% 的富人和 40% 的穷人，贫困尤其集中在非洲。国与国之间将朝着更平等的方向转变，但在国家内部，可能会朝着更不平等的方向转变。人才和资本的有效使用者将比那些拥有中等技能或很少资本的人具有决定性的优势。这种财富将是高度流动的。先进国家的穷人将无法以二十世纪的规模向富人征税；那些试图这样做的国家将在激烈的竞争中倒退。</p>

            <!-- <p>Of course, the total productivity of the world economy will continue to rise, perhaps by an average of 3 percent over the whole world, if there are no world wars. If that proves correct, the total world product will double every twenty-five years, making it more than four times as large as it is now by 2050, and sixteen to twenty times as large by 2100. Even if the world population has increased to 8 billion by 2100, that will give the world GDP per head by the end of the century ten times its present level. Such an increase in wealth can take care of the rise in the new industrial societies, and the multimillion-dollar incomes of the cognitive elite, and still provides a decent and rising standard of living for the rest of the advanced workforce. But the differentials will be very different from those of the twentieth century. In world terms the poor nations will see their incomes grow much faster than those of the rich nations; in national terms, the incomes of the rich, as in the America of the 1990s, will grow much faster than middle or low incomes. In the next century we shall witness the creation of a world superclass, perhaps of 500 million very rich people, with 100 million being rich enough to emerge as Sovereign Individuals.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>当然，如果没有世界大战，世界经济的总生产力将继续上升，也许整个世界的平均增长率为 3%。如果这被证明是正确的，世界总产值将每二十五年翻一番，到 2050 年将成为现在的四倍多，到 2100 年将成为十六到二十倍。即使到 2100 年世界人口增加到 80 亿，到本世纪末世界人均 GDP 也将是现在的十倍。这样的财富增长可以照顾到新工业社会的崛起，以及认知精英的数百万美元收入，并且仍然为其他先进的劳动力提供一个体面的和不断提高的生活水平。但差异将与二十世纪的差异有很大不同。从世界范围来看，穷国的收入增长将比富国的收入增长快得多；从国家范围来看，富人的收入，如二十世纪
                90 年代的美国，将比中等收入或低收入者的收入增长快得多。在下个世纪，我们将见证一个世界超级阶级的诞生，也许有 5 亿非常富有的人，其中 1 亿人富有到可以成为主权个体。</p>

            <!-- <p>This process will have an inevitable consequence. Societies will become much less homogeneous; the nation-state will become weaker, or crumble altogether; the cognitive elite will see itself as cosmopolitan. Already people who work in the same global functions are developing a culture that is much closer to that of their fellow workers in other parts of the world than to their fellow citizens in the old nation-states. A London investment banker will probably feel more at home in Seoul than he will in Glasgow; a Washington civil servant may feel more at home in Bonn than in black areas of Washington itself. We can already see the splintering effect that this process has on moral values. The morality of the individual is partly framed by education, by what the individual has been taught as a child; it is also partly framed by experience of life. Both the education and the experiences of the cognitive elite will be cosmopolitan, and will tend to divorce people from their local communities.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>这个过程将产生一个不可避免的后果。社会的同质性将大大降低；领土国家将变得更弱，或完全崩溃；认知精英将把自己视为世界性的。在同一全球职能部门工作的人已经在发展一种文化，这种文化与他们在世界其他地方的同僚相比，更接近他们在旧领土国家的同胞。一个伦敦的投资银行家在首尔可能比在格拉斯哥更有家的感觉；一个华盛顿的公务员在波恩可能比在华盛顿本身的黑人区更有家的感觉。我们已经可以看到这个过程对道德价值观产生的分裂效应。个人的道德观部分是由教育决定的，即个人在童年时所受的教育；它也部分是由生活经验决定的。认知精英的教育和经验都将是世界性的，并倾向于将人们从他们的本地社区中分离出来。</p>

            <!-- <p>As we move toward the next century, a high proportion of people in the growing cognitive elite have been given little religious or moral education in the family. The commonest religion of the elite is an agnostic humanism. Many such families are themselves split by divorce, remarriage, and subsequent third marriages. The marriage pattern in Hollywood is not universal in the United States, but the cognitive elite in Euro-America has a high divorce rate, probably averaging a third or more. The children of these divorced parents seldom have a basic religious education, and are aware of the variations of moral attitude between parents, stepparents, and step-siblings. If one compares the initial moral education of this group with that of an Irish or Polish village, the peasant education obviously provides much the stronger religious training of the two. A godless, rootless, and rich elite is unlikely to be happy, or to be loved.</p><span class="english"></span> -->

            <!-- <p>This inadequacy in the initial moral education of what will be the dominant economic group of the next century is likely to be reinforced by their life experience. These people will have the discipline of an advanced technical education, of one sort or another, to fit themselves for their new role as the leaders of the new electronic universe. But they will learn from that only some of the moral lessons that have historically been the framework for human social conduct. By the standards of Confucius, Buddha, or Plato (500 B.C.), St. Paul (A.D. 50), or Mahomet (A.D. 600), they may be moral illiterates. They will have been taught the lessons of economic efficiency, the use of resources, the pursuit of money, but not the virtues of humility or self-sacrifice, let alone chastity. Essentially most of them will have been brought up as pagans with a set of values closer to those of the late Roman Republic than to Christianity. Even these values will be highly individualistic, rather than shared. Societies, as we have argued, can only be strong if real moral values are widely shared. The advanced nations are already moving into the situation where many people will hold weak or limited moral values, others will compensate with fierce adherence to irrational values, and few values will be held in common across the whole of society. No doubt, some of the “competitive territorial clubs” that we described earlier will impose exacting moral standards for residence.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>下个世纪占主导地位的经济群体在最初的道德教育方面的这种不足，可能会被他们的生活经历所强化。这些人将接受这样或那样的高级技术教育，以适应他们作为新的电子世界的领导者的新角色。但他们将只从中学到一些历史上作为人类社会行为框架的道德教训。按照孔子、佛陀或柏拉图（公元前 500 年）、圣保罗（公元 50 年）或穆罕默德（公元 600 年）的标准，他们可能是道德文盲。他们会被灌输经济效率、资源利用、追求金钱的教训，但不会被灌输谦逊或自我牺牲的美德，更不用说贞洁了。从本质上讲，他们中的大多数人都是作为异教徒长大的，他们的价值观更接近于罗马共和国后期的价值观，而不是基督教。即使这些价值观也是高度个人化的，而不是共享的。正如我们所论证的那样，只有当真正的道德价值观得到广泛认同时，社会才会强大。先进国家已经进入这样一种情况：许多人将持有薄弱或有限的道德价值观，其他人将以激烈地坚持非理性的价值观作为补偿，很少有价值观会在整个社会中被共同持有。毫无疑问，我们之前描述的一些『竞争性领土国家俱乐部』将对居住地施加严格的道德标准。</p>

In dense and stable societies with strong traditions, a steep hierarchical structure. “the rich man in his castle, the poor man at his gate,” may conceal values that run through the hierarchy, but this depends upon the strength of the communal feeling of the rich and the poor, and the strength of the social traditions. Neither of these conditions exists now, and both community feeling and tradition are being weakened by the economic and technological revolution that is taking place. The lives of the many and the few are becoming more and more distant from each other. The technological revolution has been achieved by breaking away from the old ways of doing things.

As a tradition it influenced China for all recorded history, but Confucianism seems an outmoded tradition to many modern Chinese, who do not value moderation, who respect force rather than authority, and certainly do not treat others as they would wish to be treated themselves.

            <!-- <p>Several features of the new morality can be foreseen. For one thing, it will emphasize the importance of productivity and the correctness of earnings being retained by those who generate them. Another corollary point will be the importance of efficiency in investment. The morality of the Information Age applauds efficiency, and recognizes the advantage of resources being dedicated to their highest-value uses. In other words, the morality of the Information Age will be the morality of the market. As James Bennett has argued, the morality of the Information Age will also be a morality of trust. The cybereconomy will be a high-trust community. In a setting where unbreakable encryption will allow an embezzler or thief to securely place the proceeds of his crimes outside the range of recovery, there will be a very strong incentive to avoid losses by not doing business with thieves and embezzlers in the first place. Just as in the example of the Quakers cited earlier, a reputation for honesty will be an important asset in the cybereconomy. In the anonymity of cyberspace, this reputation may not always apply to a known person, but it will be reliably verifiable through identification of cryptographic keys. The possibility for radiating difficulties if encryption or certification of encrypted identities becomes corrupted by gangsters or others is daunting enough that it should strongly militate against the hiring of any person whose behavior could be indicative of a lack of trustworthiness. Bennett envisions “A Gentleman’s Club of Cyberspace,” protected areas that would require heightened security measures for participation, “possibly using biometric validation such as voice-print identification. The proprietors would assume the responsibility of vouching for the identity of the participants and to some extent their trustworthiness, achieving a ‘gentleman’s club in cyberspace’ (although ladies would be welcome these days). In these areas, people could carry on transactions with greater security and confidence than in the general realm of cyberspace. Thus the twenty-first century may see a return to a Victorian-like emphasis on trustworthiness and character in an environment no Victorian could have envisioned.”</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>可以预见新道德的几个特点。首先，它将强调生产力的重要性以及创造收益的人保留收益的正确性。另一个必然的观点是投资效率的重要性。信息时代的道德观为效率喝彩，并承认资源被用于其最高价值用途的优势。换句话说，信息时代的道德将是市场的道德。正如 James Bennett 所说，信息时代的道德也将是一种信任的道德。网络经济将是一个高信任度的社区。在这样一个环境中，牢不可破的加密技术将允许贪污犯或小偷将其犯罪所得安全地置于追讨范围之外，将有一个非常强烈的动机，通过首先不与小偷和贪污犯做生意来避免损失。就像前面提到的教友会的例子一样，诚实的声誉将是网络经济中的重要资产。在网络空间的匿名性中，这种声誉可能并不总是适用于一个已知的人，但它将通过识别加密密钥而得到可靠的验证。如果加密或加密身份的认证被歹徒或其他人破坏，可能会出现辐射性的困难，这足以使人们强烈反对雇用任何其行为可能表明缺乏可信度的人。贝内特设想了『网络空间的绅士俱乐部』，这些受保护的区域需要加强安全措施才能参与，可能使用生物识别，如声纹识别。经营者将承担保证参与者身份的责任，并在一定程度上保证他们的可信度，实现『网络空间的绅士俱乐部』（尽管现在也欢迎女士）。在这些领域，人们可以在比一般网络空间领域更安全和更有信心的情况下进行交易。因此，在二十一世纪，人们可能会看到在一个维多利亚时代无法想象的环境中，回归到维多利亚时代对可信度和性格的强调。</p>

The startling growth of world population since World War II, with its often destructive impact on forests, soils, and water resources, can be traced to intervention on a global scale.

We are too keen to believe that all cultures are created equal, too slow to recognize the drawbacks of counterproductive cultures. This is especially true of the hybrid cultures that have begun to emerge in the hothouse of subsidy and intervention in many parts of the world in this century.

Small hunting and gathering bands evolved into agriculture states, which gave way to larger-scale industrial nation-states. As archaeologist and historian Joseph A. Tainter writes in <em>The Collapse of Complex Societies,</em>“Human history as a whole has been characterized by a seemingly inexorable trend toward higher levels of complexity, specialization, and sociopolitical control.…”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en2" id="text00018.html#ch00en2">2</a></sup>Now, however, the emergence of the next stage of economic development, the Information Society, promises to reverse the apparently “inexorable trend” toward greater levels of centralization.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>迄今为止，人类社会的历史是，它们倾向于向更大的『复杂性』或社会政治控制方向发展。小规模的狩猎和采集队伍演变成了农业国家，而农业国家又让位于大规模的工业领土国家。正如考古学家和历史学家 Joseph A. Tainter 在《复杂社会的崩溃》中写道，『人类历史的整体特征是朝着更高水平的复杂性、专业化和社会政治控制的方向发展，似乎是不可阻挡的……』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en2" id="text00018.html#ch00en2">2</a></sup>然而，现在，经济发展的下一个阶段，即信息社会的出现，有望扭转这种明显的『不可阻挡的趋势』，使之走向更高水平的集中化。</p>

            <!-- <p>Tainter’s work raises many interesting questions pertinent to the themes of this book. For example, if Tainter is correct in supposing that devolution of centralized control and less redistribution of resources imply collapse, then it is unlikely that the industrial nation-state in its current form could long coexist with devolved microstates hosting Sovereign Individuals. The nation-states may be incapable of surviving on a diet of stable, much less diminished, resources. As Tainter details, when hypertrophied systems have exhausted their potential, as we believe nation-states have today, “the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns” frequently sets in. In “many crucial spheres” the returns for increased investments in centralized sociopolitical control decline, or even become negative. Hence, the phenomenon of “Parkinson’s Law,” in which the number of employees and expense of operating the British Admiralty skyrocketed over the twentieth century, while the number of ships in the British Navy shrank dramatically.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>泰因特的工作提出了许多与本书主题相关的有趣问题。例如，如果泰因特认为中央控制权的下放和资源再分配的减少意味着崩溃是正确的，那么，目前形式的工业领土国家就不可能与主持主权个体的下放的微观国家长期共存。领土国家可能没有能力在稳定的、更不用说减少的资源中生存下去。正如泰因特所详述的那样，当肥大的系统耗尽了它们的潜力，就像我们认为领土国家今天所拥有的那样，『边际收益递减法则』经常出现。在『许多关键领域』，增加对集中式社会政治控制的投资的回报率会下降，甚至变成负数。因此，出现了『帕金森定律』的现象，在二十世纪，英国海军部的雇员人数和运营费用急剧上升，而英国海军的舰船数量却急剧减少。</p>

            <!-- <p>Similar manifestations of the “Law of Diminishing Returns” are certainly in evidence in the United States and other leading economies as the twentieth century draws to a close. As Roger Lane, Professor of Social Sciences at Haverford College, wrote in “On the Social Meaning of Homicide Trends in America,” “the old institutions of social control—law, schools, police, prisons—have lost their effectiveness, despite frequent infusions of manpower and money.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en3" id="text00018.html#ch00en3">3</a></sup>There is unambiguous evidence of increasing costs for the overall burdens of government.

            <p>随着二十世纪的结束，『回报递减法则』的类似表现在美国和其他主要经济体中肯定会出现。正如哈弗福德学院社会科学教授罗杰·莱恩（<em>Roger Lane</em>）在《论美国凶杀案趋势的社会意义》中写道：『尽管频繁地注入人力和资金，但旧的社会控制机构 —— 法律、学校、警察、监狱 —— 已经失去了效力。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en3" id="text00018.html#ch00en3">3</a></sup>有毫不含糊的证据表明政府的总体负担成本不断增加。<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en4" id="text00018.html#ch00en4">4</a></sup>这是一个强烈的暗示，即使不是绝对的证据，美国整个政府活动的边际收益在不断减少。</p>

            <!-- <p>In the past, sharply diminishing marginal returns have been a prelude to collapse. The argument of this book is that the increased capacity of individuals to protect their transactions and their assets from predatory taxation implies a decline in the redistribution of resources, along with less centralized social control, less regulation and regimentation, and, ultimately, devolution of territory. All these developments have historically been, manifested in “collapse.” In Tainter’s terms, “collapse” is what happens when a centralized control system is no longer worth what it costs.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>在过去，急剧减少的边际收益是崩溃的前奏。本书的论点是，个人保护其交易和资产不受掠夺性税收影响的能力增强，意味着资源再分配的下降，同时减少集中的社会控制，减少监管和管制，以及最终的领土国家移交。所有这些发展在历史上都表现为『崩溃』。用泰恩特的话说，『崩溃是指当一个中央集权的控制系统不再值得它付出代价的时候所发生的事情。』</p>

            <!-- <p>While most individual adaptations to change are admittedly marginal and evolutionary in character, there can be revolutionary “paradigm shifts.” Sometimes, even great empires tumble as a consequence. The marginal Teturns from further investment in centralized control can become so overwhelmingly negative that it is no longer economically rational for most individuals to continue to support the old system. Tainter explains the fall of the Roman Empire in these terms. In his words, “If accounts are to be believed, at least a portion of the overtaxed peasantry openly welcomed the relief they thought the barbarians would bring from the burdens of Roman rule. And a much larger portion were evidently apathetic to the impending collapse.… The costs of empire had risen dramatically, while in the face of barbarians’ successes the protection that the State could offer to many of its citizens proved increasingly ineffectual. To many, there were simply no remaining benefits to the Empire, as both barbarians and tax collectors crossed and ravaged their land. As Gunderson notes, ‘… the net value of local autonomy exceeded that of membership in the Empire.’ Complexity was no longer yielding benefits superior to disintegration, and yet it cost so much more.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en6" id="text00018.html#ch00en6">6</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
            <p>尽管大多数个人对变化的适应都是公认的边缘性和进化性的，但也有可能出现革命性的『范式转变』。有时，甚至伟大的帝国也会因此而倒塌。进一步投资于中央控制的边际收益可能会变得非常负面，以至于对大多数人来说，继续支持旧的系统不再是经济上的理性。泰恩特用这些术语解释了罗马帝国的衰落。用他的话说，『如果账目是可信的，至少有一部分被征收过重的农民公开欢迎他们认为野蛮人会从罗马统治的负担中带来的解脱。而更多的人显然对即将到来的崩溃无动于衷…… 帝国的成本急剧上升，而面对野蛮人的成功，国家能够提供给许多公民的保护被证明越来越无效。对许多人来说，帝国根本没有剩余的好处，因为野蛮人和征税人都在他们的土地上穿越和蹂躏。』正如冈德森所指出的，『……地方自治的净价值超过了帝国成员的价值。复杂性不再产生优于解体的好处，但它的成本却高得多。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en6" id="text00018.html#ch00en6">6</a></sup></p>

        <!-- <p>Rashevsky’s analysis of the “role of determinism versus indeterminism” in history emphasizes the vulnerability of systems to radical change that can be precipitated even by a single individual when the system becomes unstable and reaches a “threshold” condition. When conditions are ripe for change (such as when diminishing marginal returns for supporting a centralized system no longer yield “benefits superior to disintegration”), then the opportunity for a radical change is so robust that practically anyone can precipitate it. Rashevsky writes, “The individual who precipitates a finite change does not have to be an <em>exceptional</em>individual. He may be <em>any</em>individual. The situation is analogous to that in a physical system, where at a point of instability an accidental displacement of any one of the trillions of <em>identical</em>molecules precipitates a finite transition to a stable state.”<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en8" id="text00018.html#ch00en8">8</a></sup></p><span class="english"></span> -->
        <p>拉舍夫斯基对历史中『决定论与不决定论的作用』的分析强调了系统对激进变化的脆弱性，当系统变得不稳定并达到『阈值』条件时，甚至可以由一个人促成。当变革的条件成熟时（例如，当支持中央集权系统的边际收益递减不再产生『优于解体的利益』时），那么激进变革的机会是如此强大，几乎任何人都可以促成它。拉舍夫斯基写道：『促成有限变革的个人不一定是一个「杰出的」个人。他可以是「任何」个人。这种情况类似于物理系统中的情况，在一个不稳定的点上，万亿个「相同的」分子中的任何一个偶然的位移都会沉淀出一个有限的过渡到一个稳定的状态。』<sup><a href="#text00023.html#ch00-en8" id="text00018.html#ch00en8">8</a></p>

<!-- <p>We cannot specify who will precipitate the collapse of the overgrown nation-state system, or when it will happen. But extrapolating from Tainter’s and Rashevsky’s analyses of the dynamics of social change, we can foresee collapse coming. The most developed and heretofore successful nation-states are all characterized by dwindling populations and massive, unfunded old-age pension liabilities. Absent unprecedented immigration from underdeveloped countries, or an unexpected influx of angels willing to work overtime and pay confiscatory tax rates, leading states in Europe, North America, and Australasia will fall far short of the revenues needed to maintain the social benefits currently delivered. Actuaries forecast rising taxes and lower benefits, i.e., diminishing marginal returns, especially for entrepreneurs who shoulder a disproportionate share of the tax burden.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
<p>我们无法明确谁会促使过度膨胀的领土国家体系崩溃，也无法明确它将在何时发生。但是，从泰恩特和拉舍夫斯基对社会变革动态的分析中推断，我们可以预见到崩溃的到来。最发达的、迄今为止最成功的领土国家的特点都是人口减少和大量的、没有资金的养老金负债。如果没有来自不发达国家的史无前例的移民，或者没有出乎意料的愿意加班和支付没收税率的天使涌入，欧洲、北美和澳大拉西亚的主要国家将远远达不到维持目前提供的社会福利所需的收入。精算师们预测，税收会增加，福利会减少，也就是说，边际收益会减少，特别是对于承担了过多税收负担的企业家来说。</p>

These are precisely the persons to whom efficient minisovereignties can offer new opportunities for domicile at a negligible cost in taxes.

<!-- <p>The argument of this book clearly informs the decision to redeploy your capital, if you have any. Citizenship is obsolete. To optimize your lifetime earnings and become a Sovereign Individual you will need to become a customer of a government or protection service rather than a citizen. Instead of paying whatever tax burden is imposed upon you by grasping politicians, you will be better positioned to prosper in the Information Age by freeing yourself to negotiate a private tax treaty that obliges you to pay no more for services of government than they are actually worth to you.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
<p>这本书的论点清楚地告知了重新部署你的资本的决定，如果你有的话。公民身份已经过时了。为了优化你的终身收入并成为一个主权个体，你将需要成为政府或保护服务的客户，而不是公民。与其支付由贪婪的政客强加给你的任何税收负担，你将更有能力在信息时代实现繁荣，因为你可以自由地谈判一个私人税收条约，使你为政府的服务支付的费用不超过它们对你的实际价值。</p>

<!-- <p>Based upon the history of other dominant systems facing collapse, those who opt for the <em>ultimum refugium</em>and get out early will be better off for having done so. This is already evident in the rash of laws passed during the 1990s to penalize Americans renouncing citizenship. The dangers of a nationalist reaction to the crisis of the nation-state make it important not to underestimate the scope for tyranny and mischief. Not withstanding the fact that the right to expatriate is enshrined in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, the U.S. is likely to be one of the more tyrannical jurisdictions blocking the emergence of commercialized sovereignty. You should aim never to leave your money in any jurisdiction that claims the right to conscript you, your children, or your grandchildren.</p><span class="english"></span> -->
<p>根据其他面临崩溃的主导系统的历史，那些选择终极避难所（<em>ultimum refugium</em>）并尽早退出的人将会因为这样做而变得更好。这一点在二十世纪 90 年代通过的一系列惩罚美国人放弃公民身份的法律中已经很明显了。民族主义对领土国家危机的反应的危险性使我们不能低估暴政和恶作剧的范围。尽管美国《独立宣言》中规定了出国的权利，但美国很可能是阻碍商业化主权出现的更暴虐的司法管辖区之一。你的目标应该是永远不要把你的钱留在任何声称有权征用你、你的孩子或你的孙子的管辖区。</p>

<blockquote><strong>译注</strong>：<em>refugium</em>，在养鱼业中，避难所是共享同一水源的海洋，咸淡或淡水鱼缸的附属物。它是一个单独的油底壳，连接到主油箱。它是一种『避难所』，从某种意义上说，它允许维持在主系统中无法生存的生物，无论是食用动物，厌氧反硝化细菌还是光合细菌。对于某些应用，限制水流以保护需要缓慢流动的植物或动物。</blockquote>
